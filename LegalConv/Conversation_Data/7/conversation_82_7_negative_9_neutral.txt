"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about our approach to forming a legal strategy for this case.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. What specifically worries you?'

Speaker A: 'The current strategy seems too aggressive and might push the other party into a corner, which could complicate negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a valid point. Perhaps we should consider a more flexible approach to make discussions smoother.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, exactly. Now, about the agreements. Have you had a chance to review the terms?'

Speaker B: 'I have, and everything seems to be in order. The clauses are straightforward and don’t raise any alarms.'

Speaker A: 'Good to know. Clarity in the terms is important for both sides.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It’s essential to focus there so that both parties feel confident in what’s being proposed.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's make sure we address any ambiguities that might arise as we go forward.'"
