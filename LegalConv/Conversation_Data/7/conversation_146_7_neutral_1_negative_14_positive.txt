"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing our legal strategy moving forward. It seems to be a solid foundation for the case.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, there's a lot to consider. It's neutral for now, but we need to be adaptable as things progress.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, about our client’s goals—they’ve expressed some concerns recently. They don’t seem confident in the direction we’re headed.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, they’re a bit anxious about timelines and outcomes, which isn't helping their priorities. We need to address this directly with them.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. I’ll arrange a meeting to realign their expectations.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, our witness selection has gone exceptionally well. Their preparation has added a lot of credibility to our case.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. I knew our efforts in prepping them would pay off.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, their testimonies could really make a positive impact. Let's focus on maintaining this momentum.'"
