Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. I feel confident about moving forward with it.'

Speaker A: 'However, I have to mention that the costs might be higher than anticipated. Budgeting for legal processes can be quite challenging.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Our goal is to ensure robust protection without unnecessary financial strain.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, I appreciate your guidance on this. Let’s explore those cost-effective solutions next.'"
