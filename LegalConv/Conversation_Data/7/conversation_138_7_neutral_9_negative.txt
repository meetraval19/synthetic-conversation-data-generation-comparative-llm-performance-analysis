"Speaker A: 'We've explored several avenues for this case, and I think our approach should focus on a realistic outcome.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, having a clear direction helps. How do you feel about our initial strategies?'

Speaker A: 'They seem reasonable for now, though we have to keep adapting based on how things progress.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. But what about those contractual terms? I can't believe how restrictive they've turned out to be.'

Speaker A: 'That's been our biggest hurdle for sure. Some of those clauses are really problematic.'

Speaker B: 'It's frustrating because it makes reaching a settlement more difficult than it should be.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we need to address those points precisely to ensure a fair resolution.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Hopefully, we can get some room for negotiation on those awkward terms.'"
