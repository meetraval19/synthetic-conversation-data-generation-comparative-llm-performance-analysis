"Speaker A: 'We've been making great progress with our new legal strategy. The team's insights have really been beneficial.' 

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. However, I'm concerned about our recent experiences with witness preparation. We've had a few difficulties ensuring that everyone is ready and clear on their roles.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that has been challenging. It’s crucial we allocate more resources to help with their preparation and mitigate any issues.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, our policies around confidentiality seem well-established now. The protocols are clear, and everyone seems to be on the same page about maintaining privilege.'

Speaker A: 'That’s definitely a relief. A thoroughly documented protocol does help in maintaining focus on the critical aspects without unnecessary worries.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let’s keep an eye on the strategic elements while addressing the ongoing challenges with witness management.' 

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a plan. We'll improve our current approach while ensuring we stay compliant with all procedural requirements.'"
