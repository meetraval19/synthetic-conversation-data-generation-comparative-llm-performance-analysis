Speaker B: 'Yes, I agree. There are definitely challenges there. Perhaps we need to reevaluate our tactics to better align with recent case developments.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, I've explored some alternative dispute resolution options, and they appear promising. Mediation could lead to a more favorable outcome without the lengthy court process.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It could save us both time and resources.'

Speaker B: 'Regarding our witnesses, I've begun the selection and preparation phase. So far, everything seems straightforward.'

Speaker A: 'Letâ€™s regroup tomorrow to finalize our course of action and address any remaining issues in our strategy.'
