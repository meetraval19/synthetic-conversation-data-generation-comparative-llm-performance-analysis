"Speaker A: 'I'm really optimistic about the progress we've made on our legal strategies. The new team seemed very sharp in their approach.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it's refreshing to see such innovative thinking. It should give us an edge in finalizing this agreement.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about the other part—looking into the potential conflicts—I'm not too confident about the current dispute resolution strategies.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The options on the table seem a bit limited and might not serve us well if things escalate.'

Speaker A: 'We should, perhaps, reconsider and broaden our resolution techniques. The last thing we want is prolonged litigation.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Maybe exploring some alternative methods could help, but I still have concerns about their effectiveness in complex scenarios.' 

Speaker A: 'True, but it's worth examining them closely. In the meantime, I'm thrilled with our strategic direction so far.' 

Speaker B: 'Same here. It's a promising phase as long as we address the potential pitfalls on the resolution front.'"
