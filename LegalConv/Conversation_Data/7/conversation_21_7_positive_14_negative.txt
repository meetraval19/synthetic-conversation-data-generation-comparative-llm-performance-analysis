"Speaker A: 'I'm really encouraged by the progress we've made in developing our strategy for the case. The team did an excellent job outlining key arguments.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The strategy is robust and well-thought-out, which puts us on a strong footing.'

Speaker A: 'Still, I'm concerned about selecting and preparing witnesses. The process hasn’t been as smooth as I hoped.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Some witnesses seem uncertain, and it's tricky ensuring everyone is ready for questioning.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, their hesitance worries me. We might need to revisit how we're preparing them.'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps bringing in an expert to guide the preparation could help.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. It’s crucial to ensure our witnesses are confident and credible on the stand.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Once that's sorted, I’m sure our overall case will be even more compelling.'"
