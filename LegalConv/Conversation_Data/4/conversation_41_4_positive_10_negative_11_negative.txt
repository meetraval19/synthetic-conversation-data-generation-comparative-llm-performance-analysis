"Speaker A: 'I'm glad we're all committed to maintaining confidentiality in these sessions. It's essential for building trust.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it ensures everyone can speak freely without concerns.'

Speaker C: 'I agree, it's the cornerstone of any effective mediation.'

Speaker A: 'However, I've been struggling with the approach towards engaging with the opposing parties. It often feels counterproductive.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the tone in our communications has been quite adversarial at times. It doesn't help the process.'

Speaker C: 'I understand. It can be challenging to keep things civil when stress levels are high. Perhaps we could try structured communication strategies?'

Speaker A: 'That might help. Shifting gears, do we have any updates on the cost estimates? The budget planning seems to be spiraling out of control.'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, the expenses are higher than anticipated, and it's becoming a significant concern.'

Speaker C: 'We need to reassess our strategy. Unforeseen costs shouldn't derail the entire process.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it's crucial to have a clearer financial roadmap moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Let's prioritize a budget review in our next session to address this issue head-on.'"
