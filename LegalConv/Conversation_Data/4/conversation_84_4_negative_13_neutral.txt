"Speaker A: 'I'm concerned about the recent issues with maintaining confidentiality. It seems like there have been leaks that could compromise privilege.'

Speaker B: 'I know, and it's troubling. We need to tighten our internal controls and ensure everyone understands the seriousness of these breaches.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let's also revisit our training materials to reinforce the importance of privilege with the team.'

Speaker B: 'Good idea. On another note, have you considered the current settlement options on the table?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I've reviewed them. They seem balanced, but I'm not sure if they align perfectly with our long-term strategy.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The options aren't bad, but perhaps we need more input from our stakeholders before deciding.'

Speaker A: 'Right, let's set up a meeting to discuss these points further and assess if any adjustments are necessary to our strategy.'"
