Speaker B: 'Certainly, keeping sensitive information protected is crucial. It’s standard, but we should ensure both parties are comfortable with the terms.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Moving on, I’d like to address the financial aspects. I'm concerned that our cost estimates might be too high. We need to avoid any budget overruns.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We should re-evaluate the budget to ensure it aligns more closely with expectations, especially in today's economic climate.'

Speaker A: 'Now, let's focus on aligning the agreement with the client’s primary goals. They’re very enthusiastic about expanding their international reach.'

Speaker B: 'I’ll draft a revised proposal that includes adjustments to the budget and highlights their priorities to reflect their strategic interests.'"
