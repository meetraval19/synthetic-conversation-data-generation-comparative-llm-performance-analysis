"Speaker A: 'I'm concerned about the confidentiality aspects of this case. We've had issues with maintaining privilege due to the complexity of communication channels.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, but we need to ensure that every step we take reinforces those boundaries to protect our client's interests.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, though it's challenging with the amount of data we're handling.'

Speaker B: 'True, but let's focus on clearly defining the team's roles to prevent any lapses. Now, regarding the client's goals, they seem straightforward, right?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, their priorities are clear, but balancing those with the timelines could be tricky.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We should ensure our approach aligns with their priorities while being transparent about what we can realistically achieve.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's revisit their objectives to confirm we're on the same page before proceeding further.'"
