Speaker B: 'Now, on the topic of reviewing evidence and documents...'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that's been quite challenging. There's a lot to go through, and frankly, it's overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'And sometimes, the way documents are presented can complicate things further.'

Speaker B: 'True. It does slow down the process, and frustrations mount as we try to make sense of everything.'
