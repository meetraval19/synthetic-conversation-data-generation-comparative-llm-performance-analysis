"Speaker A: 'I'm really concerned about the issues we're facing with confidentiality breaches in this case.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. The implications of mishandling privileged information can be severe.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to ensure all our communications are secure and clearly define privileged roles.'

Speaker B: 'On a different note, how's the progress on selecting the right individuals to testify?'

Speaker B: 'Thatâ€™s good to hear. Properly preparing them is key to a strong case.'

Speaker A: 'Switching gears, did you take a look at the agreement clauses again?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, everything seems standard. But I'll review the obligations thoroughly to avoid any surprises.'
