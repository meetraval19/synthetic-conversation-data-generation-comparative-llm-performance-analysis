"Speaker A: 'It's reassuring to see how confidentiality is prioritized in these sessions. It really allows us to speak openly.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Maintaining privilege is crucial for building trust and ensuring both parties feel protected.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, the budgeting aspect seems to be a bit challenging. The cost breakdown went way over the initial estimate.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, cost overruns are worrying. It feels like we're constantly revising our budget, and it's getting out of hand.'

Speaker A: 'Right, these unexpected expenses impact our planning significantly, and it's frustrating to not have a clear picture.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, but maybe with more detailed forecasting, we can address these issues earlier. Still, it's a lot to manage.'

Speaker A: 'I hope focusing more on these financial estimates can lead to better alignment moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, achieving clarity there could make a big difference in how smoothly we can proceed.'"
