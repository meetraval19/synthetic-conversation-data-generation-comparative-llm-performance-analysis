"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our documents, and maintaining confidentiality is becoming challenging. There are so many loopholes.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Breaches can have serious consequences, and it’s difficult to ensure everything stays privileged.'

Speaker A: 'On a different note, have we finalized the cost estimates for the case?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it’s all laid out, but it seems to align with what we expected. Neither high nor low—just about average.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. And what about the timeline? Are we on track with the key dates?'

Speaker B: 'So far, the deadlines are manageable. We should be able to meet them without much hassle.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s keep monitoring everything closely, especially with the confidentiality concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, I'll ensure we uphold our standards throughout the process.'"
