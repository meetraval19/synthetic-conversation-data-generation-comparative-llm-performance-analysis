Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. Unfortunately, there can be leaks or breaches, and it's essential to address those risks seriously.'

Speaker A: 'That’s unsettling. What can we do if we suspect an issue?'

Speaker B: 'We can take certain precautions and have remedies ready, but there's always an inherent risk.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, what about the plans for putting the legal strategies into action?'

Speaker B: 'Enforcement and implementation can often hit snags. It's not uncommon to face challenges in how smoothly everything runs.'

Speaker A: 'I see. So, it might take some time to see results?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, exactly. It's often more gradual than immediate, which can be a bit frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'Understood. On a brighter note, how are we shaping the core arguments for the case?'

Speaker B: 'That's where things are really looking up! We've crafted a strong framework for our argument, and I’m confident it will hold up well.'

Speaker A: 'That’s reassuring to hear! At least we have a solid foundation to work from.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, with a well-formulated argument, we have a good chance of success.'"
