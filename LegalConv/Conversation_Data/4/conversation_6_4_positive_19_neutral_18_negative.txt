"Speaker A: 'Let's start by acknowledging the importance of keeping our discussions confidential. It’s essential for building trust in this process.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Confidentiality and privilege ensure that everyone feels secure, which can lead to a more open and productive dialogue.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, we should clarify the steps forward. How do you suggest we outline our next actions?'

Speaker B: 'We need to ensure the action items are practical and clearly defined. This will help us stay on track as we move through the mediation.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, it’s crucial to have clarity on our next steps to maintain momentum.'

Speaker B: 'However, I'm concerned about the possible challenges we might face in enforcement. Sometimes, implementation can be quite problematic.'

Speaker A: 'You're right. Past experiences have shown us that enforcement issues can arise, and they often complicate the resolution process.'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps we should set up a framework that anticipates these obstacles, so we're better equipped to handle them.' 

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a solid plan. Let's remain proactive to minimize any setbacks in implementing our agreement.'"
