Speaker B: 'The terms are quite standard, but they could benefit from some refinement, especially regarding deliverables.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. A thorough review can prevent any potential misunderstandings in the future.'

Speaker B: 'A well-drafted contract can indeed make a big difference by minimizing disputes and clarifying responsibilities for all parties involved.'"
