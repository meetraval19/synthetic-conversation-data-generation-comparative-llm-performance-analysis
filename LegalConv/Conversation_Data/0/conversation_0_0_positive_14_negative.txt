"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how our team identified the key issues in your intellectual property case.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that was incredibly reassuring. It feels like we're on solid ground knowing exactly what we're facing.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it helps us build a strong foundation for your case. Now, about selecting and preparing witnesses, that part can be a bit challenging.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve heard it can be quite daunting, especially ensuring they are well-prepared for cross-examination.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Hopefully, our preparation can minimize any nerves or surprises.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. We'll work closely to ensure they understand the process and feel confident.' 

Speaker B: 'I really hope they don’t feel overwhelmed. Having supportive preparation certainly seems key.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll do our best to make sure they are ready and comfortable.'"
