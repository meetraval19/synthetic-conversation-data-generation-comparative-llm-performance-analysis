Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Identifying potential hurdles early can really change the outcome.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. However, we hit a bit of a snag during the contractual terms review. There were several clauses that raised red flags.'

Speaker B: 'Ah, yes. Reviewing such terms can sometimes open a can of worms. It's challenging when inconsistencies start popping up.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, the ambiguity in the language made negotiations more complicated than expected.'

Speaker B: 'That's always tough. However, catching these early can at least save bigger headaches down the line.'

Speaker A: 'True, addressing them now means fewer unexpected surprises during implementation.'"
