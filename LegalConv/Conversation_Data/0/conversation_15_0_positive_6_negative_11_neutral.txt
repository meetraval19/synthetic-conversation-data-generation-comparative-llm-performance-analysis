"Speaker A: 'I’m glad you reached out to us; identifying the core legal concerns is a great first step.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed, but it’s reassuring to know the issues are clearer now.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, clarity is key. Next, we should discuss gathering necessary documents and evidence.'

Speaker B: 'That part worries me. I’ve heard it can be quite cumbersome and not always straightforward.'

Speaker A: 'You’re right, it can be challenging. Sometimes evidence isn't as cooperative as we'd like, but we'll tackle it methodically.'

Speaker B: 'I hope it won’t complicate things too much. I want to ensure everything is in place.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll handle it, no need to worry excessively. Let’s also go through the expected costs for your case.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, having a financial roadmap would help me manage things better.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll outline a realistic budget plan, so there are no surprises along the way.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. I want to feel prepared on all fronts.'"
