"Speaker A: 'I appreciate how swiftly we identified the core issues in this case. It really sets a constructive tone for our negotiation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a clear understanding of the key matters definitely gives us a positive start.'

Speaker A: 'Now, when looking at the financial side of things, the projected costs are higher than expected, which is rather concerning.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, budgeting has been tricky, and these cost estimates can really put a strain on the resolution process.'

Speaker A: 'It would be ideal if we could explore ways to manage these expenses without compromising on quality.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, it's important to find a balance, though it's challenging with such steep financial projections in mind.'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on first finding some common ground where we already have clarity, and then tackle the budgeting issues collectively.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a sensible approach. Dealing with one aspect at a time can help manage the negative implications better.'"
