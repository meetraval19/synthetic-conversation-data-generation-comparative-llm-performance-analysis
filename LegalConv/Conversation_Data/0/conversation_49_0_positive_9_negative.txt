"Speaker A: 'Identifying potential legal issues early on really streamlines our processes, don't you think?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, anticipating these issues can save us from a lot of trouble later.'

Speaker A: 'On the other hand, going through the contractual clauses can be quite overwhelming, especially with complex language.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Some terms seem intentionally difficult to interpret, making it challenging to ensure they're equitable.'

Speaker A: 'Still, identifying and addressing these issues is worth the effort in the long run.'

Speaker B: 'For sure. Itâ€™s a lot easier to deal with problems when you catch them early rather than untangling contract disputes later on.'"
