Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Once we have everything on the table, we can work towards clarity.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, considering various ways to resolve this, do any particular methods stand out?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I've seen complications arise with arbitration. Often, it doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome for either party.'

Speaker B: 'That’s worth exploring. Maybe innovative methods could offer a more positive path forward.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, let’s delve into those options further, hoping for a solution that works effectively for both sides.'"
