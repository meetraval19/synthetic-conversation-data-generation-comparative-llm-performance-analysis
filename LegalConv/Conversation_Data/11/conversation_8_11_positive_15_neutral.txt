"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased to share that our initial cost estimates and budget planning are looking favorable for your case.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring to hear. I was concerned about potential unexpected costs.'

Speaker A: 'We've streamlined the process to ensure transparency and efficiency. You should feel confident about the financial aspect.'

Speaker B: 'Great, thanks for that. Now, about crafting the argument for my case, what does that process look like?'

Speaker B: 'Sounds straightforward enough. How adaptable is this framework? In case new evidence emerges?'

Speaker A: 'It's quite flexible. We can adjust the argumentation to incorporate new information, ensuring we stay aligned with your best interests.'
