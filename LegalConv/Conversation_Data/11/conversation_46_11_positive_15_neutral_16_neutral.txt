"Speaker A: 'I think we've done an excellent job with our cost estimates and budget planning. It's clear that settling now will save everyone considerable expense.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, managing the costs upfront has certainly been beneficial. It’s more economical than dragging this through the courts.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Now, regarding the arguments each side has formulated, how do we proceed? It seems both are pretty balanced.'

Speaker B: 'I see it the same way. Neither side has a definitive upper hand, which makes settlement a reasonable option.'

Speaker A: 'And as for the governing law and jurisdiction, keeping it neutral seems to have worked well for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It’s ensured fair considerations throughout. Continuing on this path could help us close this matter efficiently.'"
