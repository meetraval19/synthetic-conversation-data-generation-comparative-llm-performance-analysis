"Speaker A: 'Let's talk about the financial aspects. The current cost projections seem to be escalating beyond our initial estimates.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, the budget has been challenging. We need to address that to find a feasible resolution.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, moving on to the matter of which laws should apply, do we have clarity on which jurisdiction we're looking at?'

Speaker B: 'We're considering several options, but there's consensus we should choose the one that minimizes conflicts and aligns with both parties' interests.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. How about we proceed with the document review? Have we gathered all the necessary evidence to support our positions?'

Speaker B: 'We're still compiling. The initial review looks comprehensive, so we should be in a good place to make informed decisions.'

Speaker A: 'Great. Let's ensure all reviews are thorough before moving forward.' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let's keep everything streamlined to avoid further complexities.'"
