"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how the cost estimates and budget planning have come together for this case. We've managed to project a very reasonable budget.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. It's always helpful when the financial aspect aligns well. But I'm concerned about our client's changing goals and priorities.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Adapting to shifting client expectations can be a challenge. It feels like every week they introduce a new concern that redirects our focus.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it complicates our strategy. It's difficult to maintain consistency when priorities aren't clear.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we can arrange a meeting to better clarify their objectives and try to get everyone back on the same page.'

Speaker B: 'That's a good idea. Open communication might help minimize these disruptions and align their goals with our current plan. Let's set that up soon.'"
