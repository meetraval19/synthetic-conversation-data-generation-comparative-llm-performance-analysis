"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about the budget overruns we’ve been seeing lately. It seems our initial cost estimates might have missed some key expenses.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the financials have been tighter than expected. We may need to reevaluate our planning approach to avoid any unexpected costs moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It’s essential to find a more accurate way to forecast these expenses. Shifting to our next point, how do you feel about including mediation as a primary method for dispute resolution in our contracts?'

Speaker B: 'Mediation could be a practical option. It often allows for more flexible solutions without the drawn-out timelines of litigation.'

Speaker A: 'That’s true, and it might help preserve business relationships. Still, we should consider specifying arbitration if mediation fails. It keeps things neutral and streamlined.'

Speaker B: 'I think having both options provides a balanced approach. Let’s draft the clauses accordingly to ensure clarity for all parties involved.'"
