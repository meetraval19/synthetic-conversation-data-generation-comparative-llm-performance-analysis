"Speaker A: 'We're really struggling with the budget constraints on this case. The cost estimates have exceeded what we initially planned.'

Speaker B: 'I completely understand. Itâ€™s been a challenge managing the unexpected expenses. We need to reevaluate and possibly cut down on some external consultations.'

Speaker A: 'That seems necessary, but it might affect the quality of our preparation. We have to find a balance somehow.'

Speaker B: 'True, but let's shift focus to our legal arguments. We need them to be robust, especially with the opposing counsel being quite formidable.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. The facts are on our side; we just need to ensure they're presented logically and clearly.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let's refine our points during the next meeting and see where we can strengthen our position.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a plan. The financial aspect is daunting, but focusing on solid arguments can really help us here.'"
