Speaker B: 'Yes, I went through all the documents. The evidence is strong and should support our case well.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. A solid foundation makes a big difference in preparation.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and having all the necessary documents organized will make our argument more compelling.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, about the costsâ€”how are we looking on estimates and budget?'

Speaker B: 'Pretty standard, actually. We've accounted for everything, but it's always a bit of a balancing act.'

Speaker A: 'Understandable. As long as we stay on track, we should be in good shape.'
