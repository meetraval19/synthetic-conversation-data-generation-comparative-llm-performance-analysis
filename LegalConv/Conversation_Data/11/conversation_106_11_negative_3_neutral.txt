"Speaker A: 'We've been reviewing our cost estimates for the case, and it looks like we're going over budget.'

Speaker B: 'That's concerning. Are the expert witness fees higher than anticipated?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, and some unexpected expenditures have cropped up as well.'

Speaker B: 'We need to find a way to manage these costs or reassess our strategy.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, regarding our legal risk assessment, have you looked into the recent developments?'

Speaker B: 'I did. The likelihood of certain outcomes hasn't changed dramatically, but there are a few new factors to consider.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like it's mostly steady then, but we should keep monitoring any subtle shifts.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Staying on top of these changes is crucial for our case progression.'"
