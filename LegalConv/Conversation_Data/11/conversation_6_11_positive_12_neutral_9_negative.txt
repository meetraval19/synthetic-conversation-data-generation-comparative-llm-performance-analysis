Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it's a great achievement. Now, ensuring things are financially viable really puts us in a strong position.'

Speaker A: 'Shall we move on to the regulatory aspects next? I believe the compliance review is quite straightforward this time around.'

Speaker A: 'Great, it's always reassuring when compliance doesn't throw any surprises at us.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Now, about the contractual terms, I noticed a few areas that might be problematic.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I share your concerns. Some of the clauses seem quite restrictive and might not work in our favor.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. I think we need to revisit the terms and negotiate some adjustments.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, let's make sure we get that sorted to avoid any future complications.'"
