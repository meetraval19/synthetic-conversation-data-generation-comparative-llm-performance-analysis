Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a solid financial plan helps us focus on the essentials without worrying about overspending.'

Speaker A: 'However, I'm a bit concerned about our strategy development. It seems like we're hitting more roadblocks than anticipated.'

Speaker B: 'I've noticed that too. The lack of clarity from recent regulatory changes is making it tough to develop a strong direction.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It might be wise to reassess some of our assumptions and get more input.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good plan. On the other hand, our enforcement protocols are holding steady. Not many hiccups there.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the implementation side has been fairly consistent. We're keeping things running smoothly.'

Speaker B: 'For now, let's focus on addressing the strategy issues and maintain our momentum on the budget front.'
