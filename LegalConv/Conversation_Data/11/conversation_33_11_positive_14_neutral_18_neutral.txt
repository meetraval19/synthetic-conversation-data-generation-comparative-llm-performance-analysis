"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our cost estimates and budget planning for the upcoming case, and everything looks promising. We've managed to optimize some of the expenses without compromising quality.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Cost efficiency is key, especially with the unpredictable nature of legal expenses.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, shifting gears—how are we approaching the selection and preparation of witnesses?'

Speaker B: 'We're still in the early stages. Our main goal is to ensure they understand the process, so they feel comfortable and informed. I think it’s going to be a pretty straightforward task.'

Speaker A: 'Agree, it's crucial for them to be well-versed but not overwhelmed. On another note, any concerns about enforcement and implementation?'

Speaker B: 'Nothing major at the moment. We’re just keeping an eye on potential regulatory changes that might affect our strategy.'

Speaker A: 'That’s sensible. It’s always wise to stay proactive given the fluid nature of enforcement policies.'

Speaker B: 'Right, and as long as we’re staying flexible, we should be able to adapt to whatever comes our way.'"
