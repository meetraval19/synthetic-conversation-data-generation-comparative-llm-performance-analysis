"Speaker A: 'The approach we discussed earlier on streamlining the cost estimates has been showing great promise.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a clear budget plan helps everyone align their expectations upfront.'

Speaker A: 'It's reassuring to see that aspect becoming more efficient. However, there have been concerns arising around identifying potential legal pitfalls.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, some issues have emerged that weren't initially anticipated.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, it's always challenging to foresee every possible legal complication.'

Speaker A: 'We should probably devise a more robust strategy for uncovering these issues earlier in the planning stages.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Finding a solution might save us from more serious setbacks in the future.'"
