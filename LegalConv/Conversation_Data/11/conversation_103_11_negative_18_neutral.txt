"Speaker A: 'I'm concerned about the cost estimates for this case. They're skyrocketing beyond what we initially budgeted for.'

Speaker B: 'I know, it's a tough situation. Allocating funds was tricky enough, and now we're struggling to manage the unexpected expenses.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it's putting a strain on our resources. We need to find a way to streamline this.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, have you looked into the enforcement aspects for the proposed outcome of the case?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I have. It's complicated, to be honest. The implementation might not go as smoothly as we hope.'

Speaker B: 'Thatâ€™s what I thought. It's often a challenge to ensure everything is executed seamlessly once policies are in place.'

Speaker A: 'True, there's always the bureaucratic hurdles to consider. But we'll need to focus on them as we prepare our arguments.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let's tackle that with a clear plan, and maybe that will help mitigate some of these issues.'"
