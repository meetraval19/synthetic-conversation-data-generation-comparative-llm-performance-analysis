"Speaker A: 'When starting with our legal risk assessment, I think we should begin by considering the financial aspects. Cost estimates are crucial for understanding the budget scope.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a detailed budget plan helps in setting clear expectations. It's fairly straightforward but important to keep things neutral and objective there.'

Speaker A: 'Now, moving on to selecting and preparing witnesses, it's quite a challenge, isn't it?'

Speaker B: 'It can be very stressful. The unpredictability of a witness's performance during a high-pressure situation often poses significant risks.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Even with rigorous preparation, there's always a level of uncertainty that comes with relying on testimonies.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. And when we think about evaluating evidence and reviewing documents, it often feels overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Missed details in document review can lead to serious oversights, which is concerning.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the sheer volume and complexity of documents can sometimes lead to critical issues being overlooked.'

Speaker A: 'All these aspects highlight the importance of a comprehensive risk assessment strategy across all stages.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, while some areas are straightforward, others require a more cautious and detailed approach.'"
