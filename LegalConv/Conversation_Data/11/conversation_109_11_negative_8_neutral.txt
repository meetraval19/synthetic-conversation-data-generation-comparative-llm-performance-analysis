"Speaker A: 'I’ve reviewed the budget proposal, and it seems we're significantly over the initial estimates.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, the rising project costs are definitely concerning. We need to find a way to cut expenses without compromising quality.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we can renegotiate some terms with the suppliers to help with that.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a good idea. Meanwhile, for our dispute resolution section, I thought of adding a mediation clause.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds reasonable. Mediation can be a way to address conflicts without heading straight to litigation.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It’s flexible and can save both time and resources.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, let's finalize those changes and address the budget concerns head-on.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's tackle this efficiently and ensure the contract meets both parties' needs.'"
