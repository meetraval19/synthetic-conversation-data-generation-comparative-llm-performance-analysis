"Speaker A: 'Thanks for meeting with me. I'm concerned about how expensive this legal process might get.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Legal matters can indeed be costly, and planning the budget is crucial, but it can also be frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'I was hoping there might be a way to minimize some of those costs.'

Speaker B: 'We'll certainly do our best to keep things efficient. Now, about the documents – have you thought about the specific clauses you might need?'

Speaker A: 'I’m not entirely sure. I was hoping you could help guide me through what's typical or necessary.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. Drafting these documents is pretty straightforward once we discuss your needs. We can review them together to ensure everything's covered.'

Speaker A: 'That would be great. I'm also unsure about how to handle communication with the other party.'

Speaker B: 'No worries. We’ll assist you through every step of the negotiation process. Communication here is usually just about being clear and precise.'

Speaker A: 'That’s helpful to know. I appreciate your guidance on both these matters.'

Speaker B: 'I’m here to make the process as smooth as possible for you. Let's tackle it one step at a time.'"
