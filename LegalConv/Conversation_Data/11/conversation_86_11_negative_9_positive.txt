"Speaker A: 'I appreciate you meeting with me today to discuss my intellectual property needs.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. Let's start by reviewing the draft agreements. The terms seem very favorable to you, giving you plenty of flexibility.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a relief. Having clear terms really eases my mind. What about the cost estimates for this process? I hope it won’t be overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concern. It’s true that managing these costs can get quite challenging. Legal fees and other expenses can add up, which is something to be mindful of.'

Speaker A: 'I was worried about that. Do we have any strategies to keep the costs manageable while still protecting my interests?'

Speaker B: 'We can certainly look into some budget-friendly options and prioritize essential services. It's crucial to find a balance between maximizing protection and minimizing expenses.'

Speaker A: 'I’d appreciate that. With the contracts looking solid, I feel confident about the terms moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It’s a great starting point, and having thorough agreements can save you from potential disputes later.'

Speaker A: 'Thank you. I feel more prepared to tackle the legal aspects with your guidance.'

Speaker B: 'Glad to be of help. We'll make sure everything is as streamlined as possible.'"
