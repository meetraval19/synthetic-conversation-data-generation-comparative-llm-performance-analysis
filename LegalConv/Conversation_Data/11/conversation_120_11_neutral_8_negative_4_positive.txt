"Speaker A: 'Let's start with an overview of the cost estimates. We need to ensure our budget planning is realistic for this case.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We should be as precise as possible. It's important to avoid any surprises down the road.'

Speaker A: 'What about our options for resolving the dispute?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it's looking challenging. The negotiation has been tougher than expected.'

Speaker A: 'That's unfortunate, but perhaps shifting our approach might open new avenues in mediation.'

Speaker B: 'Weâ€™ll definitely need to explore that further. Now, how are we handling confidentiality?'

Speaker A: 'I think we're in a strong position. Our protocols are solid, and I have full confidence in our adherence to privilege.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. With confidentiality under control, we can focus more on strengthening our strategic angles.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Let's keep that momentum going as we refine our arguments for the case.'"
