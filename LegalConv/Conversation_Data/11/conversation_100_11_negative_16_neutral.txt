"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the cost estimates for our upcoming case, and it's concerning how quickly expenses are adding up.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, budget planning always seems more optimistic than reality. We might need to reconsider some elements to avoid overspending.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Perhaps looking into external consultations could offer some savings, but it's still risky.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, we should be cautious. On another note, have you thought about the implications of selecting the governing law for this case?'

Speaker A: 'I have. It's complex, given the multiple jurisdictions involved, but it seems straightforward without any clear advantages or disadvantages.'

Speaker B: 'It doesn't tilt in anyone's favor at this point, right?'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it's a neutral aspect, but we need to keep an eye on any local legislative changes that might occur.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a good point. We'll need to stay updated to ensure we’re not caught off guard with jurisdictional shifts.'"
