"Speaker A: 'We've done a thorough review of the potential costs; it seems manageable.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The budget planning is straightforward, but we need to ensure flexibility for any unexpected expenses.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On another note, our team is quite optimistic about the arguments we've prepared for your case.'

Speaker B: 'Thatâ€™s reassuring to hear. A strong legal argument can make all the difference in reaching a fair resolution.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding the contract terms, there are a few clauses that need attention.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, some of those terms are quite problematic. They could pose significant challenges if not addressed properly.'

Speaker A: 'Right, we'll have to tackle those issues head-on to avoid any complications later.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's better to sort them out now rather than face legal hurdles down the line.'"
