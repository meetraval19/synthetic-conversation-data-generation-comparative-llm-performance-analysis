"Speaker A: 'When it comes to planning the budget for your case, we've outlined some cost estimates that will likely align with your financial expectations.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief. Sticking to a budget is really important for me.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We've had success in managing similar cases efficiently. Now, let's discuss the next stepâ€”preparation of the witnesses.'

Speaker B: 'I've heard that preparing witnesses can be challenging. Is that true?'

Speaker B: 'That sounds daunting. How do you usually handle those complications?'

Speaker A: 'We take extra care. This ensures they feel comfortable and understand the questions they might face. However, unexpected issues can still arise.'

Speaker B: 'I see. I trust that with your experience, you'll guide us through.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Our aim is to handle everything as smoothly as possible, despite the potential challenges with witness preparation.'"
