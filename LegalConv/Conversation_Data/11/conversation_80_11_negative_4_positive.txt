"Speaker A: 'I understand that the budget has been a point of contention for both parties in this arbitration.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The cost estimates initially provided were way off, and it’s been difficult to manage expectations around that.'

Speaker C: 'I hear you both. It's challenging when financial projections don't align with reality.'

Speaker A: 'However, despite the budget issues, we've managed to ensure all sensitive information remains protected.'

Speaker C: 'That's a crucial point. Maintaining confidentiality is essential, and it’s been reassuring to see strict measures in place.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The integrity of our confidential data has not been compromised, which helps build trust on both sides.'

Speaker A: 'While we work through these financial concerns, it's important that we continue prioritizing this level of discretion.' 

Speaker C: 'Definitely. Let's focus on resolving the cost discrepancies while maintaining our commitment to confidentiality and privilege.'"
