"Speaker A: 'I understand the settlement talks have reached a stage where cost estimates are becoming a concern.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. The initial budget projections were overly optimistic, and we're facing overruns.'

Speaker A: 'It's frustrating, especially since the unexpected expenses affect both sides.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We're committed to finding a solution, though itâ€™s proving challenging.'

Speaker A: 'What about the timeline? Are the key dates still feasible given the current situation?'

Speaker B: 'For the most part, yes. We're still aligned with the agreed milestones.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. At least the timeline gives us some stability in an otherwise complex negotiation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We can at least anticipate the next steps without too much deviation.'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on adjusting the budget realistically so we can avoid further complications.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Addressing the cost concerns is crucial for a smooth settlement process.'"
