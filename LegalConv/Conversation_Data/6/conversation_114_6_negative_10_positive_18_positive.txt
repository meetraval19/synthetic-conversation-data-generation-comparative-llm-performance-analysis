"Speaker A: 'We've hit some challenges with the review of documents and evidence. The volume is overwhelming, and there are inconsistencies we didn’t anticipate.'

Speaker B: 'I hear you, but let's focus on the positives. Our negotiations have been quite effective. The opposing parties seem open to constructive dialogue this time.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a relief! Their willingness to engage positively can certainly ease some of the stress we’re facing with the document review.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Once we navigate the evidence issues, we can leverage our strong communication to smooth out enforcement and implementation.'

Speaker A: 'I'm optimistic about that aspect. With everyone on board, implementing our strategies should be straightforward and effective.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It’s encouraging to see things aligning in that regard, despite the initial hurdles.'"
