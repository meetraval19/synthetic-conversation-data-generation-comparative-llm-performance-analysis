"Speaker A: 'As we begin this mediation session, let's start with a thorough review of the documents and evidence presented by both sides.'

Speaker B: 'That's a good starting point, ensuring we have all the details clear will help us maintain an unbiased perspective.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding the interactions between the involved parties, it seems there have been some significant challenges.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, unfortunately, communication has been difficult and often counterproductive. It's causing more tension than resolution.'

Speaker B: 'I agree; there's been a lot of hostility and misunderstanding. We need to find a way to ease these interactions.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps focusing on clear, respectful dialogue moving forward could help both parties feel more understood and less adversarial.'"
