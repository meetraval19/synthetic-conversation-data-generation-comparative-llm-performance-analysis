"Speaker A: 'I’ve been going through the evidence for our case, and it’s quite troubling. Some of the documents are incomplete.'

Speaker B: 'That’s concerning. We'll need to address these gaps before the presentation.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It’s frustrating how often these issues come up. We need a solid strategy to mitigate this.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We also need to think about how enforcement might play out. There can be multiple hurdles there.'

Speaker A: 'True, especially given the current administrative setup. It’s neither straightforward nor impossible.'

Speaker B: 'Right, we should prepare for any implementation challenges. That way, we’re not caught off guard during the proceedings.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let’s ensure our arguments account for both areas effectively.'"
