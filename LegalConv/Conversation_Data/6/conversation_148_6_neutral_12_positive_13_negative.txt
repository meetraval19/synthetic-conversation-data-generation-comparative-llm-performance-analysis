Speaker B: 'Agreed. Going through the evidence thoroughly will give us a neutral baseline to work from.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Our recent efforts in adhering strictly to regulations have put us in a favorable position.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. However, when it comes to settlement options, things aren't looking too promising.'

Speaker B: 'I know. The strategy isn’t ideal, and the potential outcomes just don’t seem favorable right now.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s keep our focus sharp and see if we can navigate through this effectively with what we have.'"
