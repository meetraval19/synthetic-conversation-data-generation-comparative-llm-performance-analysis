"Speaker A: 'We've been stuck going through pages of documents and evidence. It's been quite frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the sheer amount can be overwhelming and tedious at times, I agree.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, we've finally agreed on the applicable laws and the jurisdiction. It's quite a relief to have clarity on that front.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it was definitely a smooth discussion, and I think it sets a solid foundation for our negotiation.'

Speaker A: 'Another positive is how efficiently we've pinpointed the core legal issues in this case.'

Speaker B: 'I couldn't agree more. Identifying those issues early on really helped in streamlining our approach to the settlement.'

Speaker A: 'Now, if only reviewing the documents was as straightforward as sorting out the legal concerns!'

Speaker B: 'If only! But we'll work through it. The major hurdles seem to be out of the way, thankfully.'"
