"Speaker A: 'During our compliance review, I noticed that the evidence and document gathering process is quite thorough. We seem to have all the necessary paperwork.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but it's just the start. Reviewing these documents is critical to ensuring we meet regulatory standards.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Consistency in documentation helps in maintaining neutrality during audits.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. However, I’m concerned about the action items from our last meeting.'
