"Speaker A: 'Thanks for meeting with me. I've been reviewing the evidence, and there are some inconsistencies that could pose challenges.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It’s been quite stressful hearing about those issues.'

Speaker A: 'Don't worry too much. We’ll find a way to address them. Now, let's chat about what you’re hoping to achieve with this case.'

Speaker B: 'Well, my main priority is to ensure a fair resolution while minimizing any impact on my daily life.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. Focusing on your goals can really help guide the strategy. We’ll work to align our approach with what’s most important to you.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Having clear goals definitely makes me feel more optimistic about the outcome.'"
