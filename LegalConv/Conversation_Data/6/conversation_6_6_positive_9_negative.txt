"Speaker A: 'I've been impressed with the thoroughness of our evidence and document review. It’s been incredibly helpful in clarifying the situation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having all the facts laid out clearly makes a big difference in moving forward. It provides a solid foundation for our discussions.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It gives us a clear perspective and helps in making informed decisions as we go through this process.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. On the other hand, I'm concerned about the complications arising from the review of the contractual terms. There seem to be quite a few ambiguities that might pose challenges.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, those uncertainties can definitely affect progress. The language used is causing more confusion than clarity in some areas.'

Speaker B: 'It's frustrating because these unclear terms lead to disagreements, which prolongs our arbitration session.'

Speaker A: 'Certainly, we need to address those ambiguities carefully to ensure everyone’s on the same page and prevent further disputes.'

Speaker B: 'Precisely. Perhaps revisiting those sections with an aim to simplify and clarify might help us avoid obstacles in the future.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. While it’s a challenge, we should focus on streamlining these details to facilitate smoother negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s aim for a resolution that minimizes these ambiguities. It’s crucial for achieving a fair and mutually agreeable outcome.'"
