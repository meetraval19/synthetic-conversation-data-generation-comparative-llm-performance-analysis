"Speaker A: 'I’ve been going through the evidence and documents, and it's a mess. Some files are incomplete, and others are barely legible.'

Speaker B: 'That’s frustrating. We need to make sure everything is in order before presenting it.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It feels like we're starting a step behind. I wish we had more time to sort this out.'

Speaker B: 'We’ll have to make do with what we have and be meticulous in how we present our case.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, how should we approach our legal strategy? We need something solid to offset the documentation issues.'

Speaker B: 'Given the circumstances, I think we should focus on clarity. A straightforward strategy will help us argue effectively.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We’ll need to anticipate their moves and prepare responses to potential objections.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, staying adaptable is key. It’s about making sure we’re ready for any curveballs.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like our best bet. Let’s refine the plan and get ready for tomorrow.'"
