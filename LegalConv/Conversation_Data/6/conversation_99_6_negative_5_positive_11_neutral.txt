"Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, the document review process has been more challenging than we anticipated. Some critical evidence is unclear.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, and it's essential we address those issues quickly. But I'm pleased to say we've made good progress on setting the timeline for key dates.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear! A well-defined timeline will help keep everything on track.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It should facilitate smoother coordination among all parties. How's the budget planning looking on your end?'

Speaker A: 'It's shaping up okay. We've outlined the cost estimates, but adjustments might be needed as we move forward.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Flexibility in budgeting is always beneficial in lengthy negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'Right, as long as we balance costs effectively, we should manage well.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. Let's revisit the document issues soon and start implementing the timeline. I'll ensure everyone stays aligned with the new dates.'

Speaker A: 'Perfect. Addressing these concerns early can really enhance the contract outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'Completely agree. Let's prioritize these next steps then.'"
