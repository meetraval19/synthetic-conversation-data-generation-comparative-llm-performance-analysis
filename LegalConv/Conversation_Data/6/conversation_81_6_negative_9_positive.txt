"Speaker A: 'Going through the evidence and documents has been tougher than expected. The volume is overwhelming, and some files seem misplaced.'

Speaker B: 'I can imagine. It’s frustrating when documents aren't organized as they should be. We need to streamline this process before it affects our timeline.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let’s prioritize digitizing the files and perhaps bring in some additional help to expedite the review. On a brighter note, have you looked into the contractual terms?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, actually. The review of the contractual terms went surprisingly well. The clauses are straightforward, and they align perfectly with our client’s needs.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. It’s good to know that part is solid. We can present a strong case with the terms favoring our position.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Now, if we can just get a handle on the evidence review, we’ll be in a much better spot.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let’s regroup with the team to discuss next steps on organizing and analyzing those documents properly.'"
