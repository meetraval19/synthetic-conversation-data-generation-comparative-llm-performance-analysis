"Speaker A: 'I spent all night reviewing documents and it’s worse than I thought. There are gaps in the evidence that might hurt our case.'

Speaker B: 'That’s concerning. We'll need to strategize around that. Have you looked into maintaining the confidentiality aspects properly?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, everything is in line with legal privilege guidelines. We’re covered there.'

Speaker B: 'Good to hear. It’s crucial to keep that intact. How’s the review of the contractual terms going?'

Speaker A: 'Surprisingly well, actually. The terms are solid and favor our position in the negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a relief. Solid contractual terms can give us the upper hand in court.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it's the one aspect that's giving us some leverage despite the issues with the evidence.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s focus on leveraging those terms, while finding ways to address the document gaps.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. I’ll refine our strategy on both fronts and hopefully turn things around.'"
