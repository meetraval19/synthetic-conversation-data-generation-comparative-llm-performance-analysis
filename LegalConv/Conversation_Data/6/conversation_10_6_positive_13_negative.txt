"Speaker A: 'I went through the document review, and it's looking really promising for our case.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Solid evidence can make all the difference in court.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It gives us a strong foundation to argue from.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, have you considered the settlement options?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, but I’m concerned. The current strategy isn’t in our client's best interests.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It feels like the options on the table might not fully reflect what we deserve.'

Speaker A: 'Right. We need to reassess and figure out a more favorable strategy.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let’s make sure we cover all bases so our client gets the best outcome possible.'"
