"Speaker A: 'We've made great progress with the evidence reviews. It's clear and well-organized, which gives us a strong foundation for negotiation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Having everything clearly laid out makes it much easier to push for a favorable settlement.'

Speaker A: 'However, I'm a bit concerned about maintaining confidentiality. It's crucial that we keep privileged information secure during these discussions.'

Speaker B: 'I completely agree. If anything were to leak, it could really harm the negotiation process and our position.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. But let's stay focused on leveraging our robust evidence to reach a satisfactory agreement.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, let’s ensure our approach emphasizes the strengths we’ve established. It’s important to navigate any risks carefully.'"
