Speaker B: 'That's unfortunate. It's crucial to have a comprehensive view before proceeding.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We should consider allocating more resources to streamline the review process.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, how's the communication with the other side going?'

Speaker A: 'We're developing them, but nothing groundbreaking yet.'

Speaker B: 'It sounds like we're on steady ground for now. Let's keep everything aligned as we continue.'"
