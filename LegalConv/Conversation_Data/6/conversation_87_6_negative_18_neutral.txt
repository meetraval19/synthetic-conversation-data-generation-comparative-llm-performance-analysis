"Speaker A: 'The recent document review process was quite frustrating. Did you encounter the same issues with evidence management?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it’s been a challenging task. The inconsistencies in the document submissions made things unnecessarily complicated.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It feels like every time we think we have a handle on it, something new crops up.'

Speaker B: 'And then when it comes to enforcement, I find it’s more about ensuring every policy is understood and consistently implemented, rather than actual resistance.'

Speaker A: 'Right, the implementation phase seems more straightforward compared to the chaos of documentation.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. There’s a sense of order once everything is in place, though initial steps can be tedious at times.'

Speaker A: 'True, but perhaps with better initial planning, these reviews could be less of a hassle.' 

Speaker B: 'Hopefully, improvements in procedure could streamline the process for everyone involved.'"
