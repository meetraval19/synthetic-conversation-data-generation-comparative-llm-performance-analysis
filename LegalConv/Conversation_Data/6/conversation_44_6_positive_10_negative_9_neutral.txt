Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the detailed analysis work really strengthens our position.'

Speaker A: 'On the other hand, I find communication with opposing parties incredibly challenging. It seems like they're not open to any form of discussion.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Their lack of cooperation makes negotiations unnecessarily difficult and tense.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. As for reviewing the contractual terms, how do you feel that’s progressing?'

Speaker B: 'It's going smoothly. There aren’t any major issues, but we do need to keep an eye on any technicalities that might arise.'

Speaker A: 'Right, ensuring we don't overlook any small details can be crucial for avoiding future disputes.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, it’s all about staying vigilant and prioritizing clarity in the terms to prevent ambiguities.'"
