"Speaker A: 'The document review process has been rather challenging, hasn’t it? We’ve uncovered some inconsistencies that could complicate things.'

Speaker B: 'I completely understand. It’s been a tough process, but we’ll have to address those issues methodically.'

Speaker A: 'Have you had a chance to look over the latest draft of the settlement terms?'
