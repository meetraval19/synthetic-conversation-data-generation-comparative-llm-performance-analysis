"Speaker A: 'During our contract negotiation, it's crucial we ensure all evidence and documents are thoroughly reviewed.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. A comprehensive review helps us stay prepared, even if it often feels routine.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. However, I'm more concerned about our options for resolving disputes. The choices seem quite limited and not very promising.'

Speaker B: 'I share your concerns. None of the options provide a straightforward path and could lead to lengthy complications.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, and identifying potential legal issues early is another priority. It's quite cumbersome and could slow down the process significantly.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It always feels like weâ€™re uncovering more problems than solutions during these reviews. We need a strategy to manage this better.'"
