Speaker B: 'Absolutely, finding those key pieces of evidence was a big win.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about our witnesses. I'm concerned about the reliability of their testimonies.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It’s been challenging preparing them. Some inconsistencies are worrying.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, their statements need to be airtight. It’s crucial we handle this carefully.'

Speaker B: 'On the other hand, have you checked on the latest updates on the statutes that might affect our case?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I did. The laws don’t seem to present any new challenges, just the usual regulations.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, we just need to focus on strengthening our strategy around what we already have.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, let’s keep our momentum going with what’s working so far.'"
