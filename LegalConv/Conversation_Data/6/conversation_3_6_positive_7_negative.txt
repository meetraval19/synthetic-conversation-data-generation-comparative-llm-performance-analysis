"Speaker A: 'I've been going through the evidence, and everything seems quite robust. The documents clearly support our case.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. A strong foundation is essential to make our arguments convincing.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It’s reassuring to see how clearly the facts align with the legal requirements.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but I'm a bit concerned about mapping out our legal strategy. It feels like there are too many hurdles along the way.'

Speaker A: 'I see what you mean. The opposition's approach is complex, and that makes it tricky to predict their moves.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Every time I think we’ve got a solid plan, there's another angle to consider.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to bring in another perspective to refine our approach and ensure we're covered.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Despite that, knowing we've got the evidence sorted does give us a good starting point to tackle these strategy challenges.'"
