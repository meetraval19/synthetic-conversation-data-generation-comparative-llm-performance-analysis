"Speaker A: 'We're having a tough time with the document review phase. Some evidence just isn't adding up.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It seems like we might be missing key pieces. It's frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to figure out how to handle this before presenting anything in court.'

Speaker B: 'On the legal strategy front, I think we're on solid ground. What are your thoughts on arguing negligence as a focal point?'

Speaker A: 'It's a reasonable approach. We have some angles that could work, but we need to adapt if new information emerges.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Flexibility will be crucial, especially given the unpredictability of the evidence situation.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let’s focus on tightening our arguments while keeping an eye on any developments.' 

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a plan. Let’s get back to it and see if we can find those missing links in the documents.'"
