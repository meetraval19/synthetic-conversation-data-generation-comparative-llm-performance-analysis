"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how we've outlined the applicable laws and jurisdictions in the contract. It'll provide clarity and stability for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having that certainty will definitely facilitate smoother implementations and avoid unnecessary disputes.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Now, moving on to the argument structure for potential disputes, I think we have a solid framework, but there's always room for refinement.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The framework is well-structured, but we might consider additional examples or scenarios to ensure it's comprehensive.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. We should look into other precedents to strengthen it further.'
