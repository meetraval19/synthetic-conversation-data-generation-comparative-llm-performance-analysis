"Speaker A: 'I’m really pleased with how the rules are playing to our advantage here. Our chosen jurisdiction is known for its fairness.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it’s a solid groundwork for our case. It’s great to have such clear cut principles to rely on.'

Speaker A: 'Now, on to drafting and reviewing these documents, I must say it’s been quite a challenge. The errors and inconsistencies are adding unnecessary delays.'

Speaker B: 'I share your frustration. It’s exhausting to keep finding issues where none should exist, but it’s crucial we get it right before presenting.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's shift our focus to formulating the arguments. How do you feel about the structure we currently have?'

Speaker B: 'It seems comprehensive at first glance. It should cover our bases without any emotional tone so we maintain objectivity.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, a balanced approach. It’s all about logical presentation and letting the facts speak for themselves.'

Speaker B: 'Right, as long as we align our facts precisely with our legal framework, it should work in our favor without much complication.'"
