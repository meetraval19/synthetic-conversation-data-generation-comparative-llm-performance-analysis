"Speaker A: 'We've hit a snag with the location for resolving disputes.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the governing framework seems to be causing more issues than solutions. It's really complicating things.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It's difficult when the laws conflict, making it hard for both parties to agree.'

Speaker B: 'But on a more positive note, the compliance review went surprisingly well.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that's a relief! It's good to see that all regulations were met without any major hiccups.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The thoroughness of the review really paid off and set a solid foundation for our operations.'

Speaker A: 'If only the jurisdiction issue were as straightforward as our compliance process.'

Speaker B: 'True, addressing that will require some creative problem-solving. But at least we're on the right track elsewhere.'"
