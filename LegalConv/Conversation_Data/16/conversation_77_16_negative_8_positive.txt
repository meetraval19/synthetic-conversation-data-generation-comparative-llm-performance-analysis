Speaker A: 'It does create hurdles, but on a brighter note, our discussion on alternative dispute resolution options went quite well.'

Speaker B: 'And potentially reduce the cost and time significantly.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, focusing on these resolution paths might be our best strategy going forward.'"
