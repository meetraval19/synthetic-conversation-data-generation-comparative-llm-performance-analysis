"Speaker A: 'Our choice of governing law and jurisdiction is really in our favor. It’s a strong point for our case.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The jurisdiction gives us a significant advantage and aligns well with precedence.'

Speaker A: 'However, have you noticed the recent challenges we’ve had when communicating with the other side? It’s been quite frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, their lack of transparency is making things unnecessarily difficult. It’s definitely a hurdle.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. A clear schedule will help us stay organized and on track.'

Speaker A: 'Great. Let’s move forward with confidence on each front.'"
