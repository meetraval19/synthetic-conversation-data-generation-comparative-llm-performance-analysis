"Speaker A: 'Let’s address the choice of applicable legal framework first. We've had issues with this in past contracts.'

Speaker B: 'I understand it's a sensitive topic. It's crucial we find a jurisdiction that doesn't pose risks for either party.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, given past experiences, it's tough to agree on one that feels fair.'

Speaker B: 'How about we pivot to resolving conflicts through mediation or arbitration instead? It’s been working well in other negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'That's a great idea! Mediation could definitely offer a more amicable solution and keep us out of court.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it saves time and, generally, leads to more satisfying outcomes for everyone involved.'

Speaker A: 'Okay, let's move on to budgetary aspects. We should ensure our forecast is solid.'

Speaker B: 'True, having clear financial projections will help in managing expectations and allocations.'

Speaker A: 'Right, we need to ensure every detail is accounted for, even though it might not be the most exciting part of this meeting.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, but a precise budget is essential for the project's success. Shall we finalize the estimates?' 

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a plan. Let’s ensure everything aligns with our goals.'"
