"Speaker A: 'I understand you're facing some challenges with the contract terms. Let's start by discussing the governing law and jurisdiction clauses you've mentioned.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, those parts feel really restrictive and concerning, especially because they seem to favor the other party.'

Speaker A: 'I can imagine how that would be frustrating. Those clauses can be tricky and often lead to difficulties in enforcing rights across different regions.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, it's like a potential legal maze.'

Speaker A: 'Let's shift to identifying the core legal issues. I'm confident we can pinpoint key areas where adjustments can be beneficial.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reassuring. I hope we can find those aspects that can be negotiated better.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. By focusing on these critical issues, we can often find strategic leverage points to work with.' 

Speaker B: 'Thanks, I feel more optimistic already about finding a way forward.'"
