Speaker B: 'That's unfortunate. It could complicate proceedings significantly.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it might. We need to reassess our strategy moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'In terms of argument formulation, how are we looking?'

Speaker A: 'It's progressingâ€”neither groundbreaking nor lacking, just straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Good to hear. At least it provides a steady base to work from.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It won't drive our win alone, but it's solid enough to support our claims.'

Speaker B: 'Let's hope shifting perspectives on jurisdiction doesn't offset our groundwork too much.'"
