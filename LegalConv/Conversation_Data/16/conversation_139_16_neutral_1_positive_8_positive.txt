"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing which jurisdiction would make sense for both parties. It's crucial we agree on this early.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, selecting a neutral jurisdiction can be beneficial, ensuring neither side feels disadvantaged.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, our client is really focused on a swift resolution so they can return to business as usual. They see this settlement as a way to achieve that.'

Speaker B: 'That's excellent to hear. My client values efficiency and is very open to creative solutions that align well with your client's goals.'

Speaker A: 'Great! On that note, let's explore different dispute resolution options. Mediation has been successful in cases like this.'

Speaker B: 'Mediation sounds promising. It's less adversarial and often allows for more flexibility, which could lead to a more satisfying outcome for both sides.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It seems we're aligned in finding a constructive path forward. Should we set up a tentative timeline to roll things out?'

Speaker B: 'That sounds perfect. Iâ€™m optimistic about reaching a fair settlement.'"
