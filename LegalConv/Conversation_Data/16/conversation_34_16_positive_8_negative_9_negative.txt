"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing the agreed legal framework. The clarity on applicable laws has been a great foundation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a defined framework really helps minimize potential confusion later.'

Speaker C: 'I agree. However, when we move to the methods of resolving disputes, there seems to be a lack of effective options.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the current methods often seem cumbersome and lead to unnecessary delays.'

Speaker B: 'It's crucial to find a more efficient way. Maybe we could look at alternative options that might suit everyone's needs better.'

Speaker C: 'I'm concerned that the existing mechanisms are just not flexible enough to handle the varied issues we see.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, there's a need to review certain terms in the contract. Some clauses seem rigid and problematic.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Several terms lack clarity, which could lead to potential misunderstandings.'

Speaker C: 'It's unfortunate, as these terms should ideally protect everyone involved, not create more disputes.'

Speaker A: 'Well, it seems we need to address these concerns comprehensively to ensure a fair resolution for all parties.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, itâ€™s important we address everything thoroughly to avoid future conflicts.'"
