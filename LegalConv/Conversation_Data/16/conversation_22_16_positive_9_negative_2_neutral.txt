Speaker B: 'That’s good to hear. I was worried about how that might affect my position.'

Speaker A: 'You're in a strong position there. However, we do need to delve into the contractual terms.'

Speaker B: 'I was hoping you could help with revising those.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, we’ll address them together. Now, regarding the relevant laws and regulations, everything looks standard.'

Speaker B: 'Does that mean there won’t be any surprises?'

Speaker A: 'Correct, the applicable regulations are pretty straightforward and nothing seems out of the ordinary.'

Speaker B: 'Great, let’s prioritize those contract terms then.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we'll ensure your interests are better protected.'"
