"Speaker A: 'Let's start by considering which jurisdiction we should agree upon. It's crucial to have a neutral ground for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. A neutral jurisdiction could streamline the resolution process without bias.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, there are some concerns about the current laws and regulations impacting our industry. They seem more hindering than helpful.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, the new regulations have been quite burdensome, creating more obstacles than solutions for businesses.'

Speaker A: 'However, our recent compliance review worked in our favor. The team was thorough, and regulators even commended our adherence.'

Speaker B: 'That’s encouraging to hear! A positive compliance review certainly strengthens our position in these negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, and having that foundation allows us to negotiate with more confidence.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s build on that momentum as we move forward in these discussions.'"
