"Speaker A: 'It looks like we've hit a snag concerning which jurisdiction should govern the contract. It's proving to be more contentious than expected.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it's been tough. Each jurisdiction has different implications, and it makes finding common ground challenging.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We need to carefully consider all possible outcomes before making a decision. Now, on to the drafting process. Have you had a chance to review the documents?'

Speaker B: 'I did. The language seems clear, but there are a few areas where we might need some clarification. It's important everything is precise.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's crucial to ensure all terms are defined explicitly to avoid ambiguity later on.'

Speaker B: 'Right, and once we finalize these details, we can focus on the next steps. I'm hopeful we can move forward soon.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds promising. Setting clear action items will definitely help streamline the rest of the process. Let’s aim for progress over perfection.'

Speaker B: 'I’m confident we'll reach an agreement. We just need to keep our focus and work through each point methodically.'"
