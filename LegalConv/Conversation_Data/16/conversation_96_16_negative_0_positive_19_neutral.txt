"Speaker A: 'Let's dive into identifying any potential issues with the current draft. I've noticed some areas where we could improve our contract terms.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, finding and resolving these issues early is promising for a smoother negotiation process.'

Speaker A: 'On the topic of jurisdiction, there's a bit of a concern. The clause seems quite restrictive, which might lead to complications down the line.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The choice of jurisdiction is rather unfavorable and could become a sticking point if we aren't careful.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, it’s something we need to address. Now, moving forward, we should outline the next steps clearly to ensure everyone’s on the same page.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Let's map out the action items so we can proceed systematically without any missteps.'

Speaker A: 'Great. By setting these actions in motion, we can keep things moving efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, aligning on these steps will definitely help in maintaining clarity and progressing smoothly.'"
