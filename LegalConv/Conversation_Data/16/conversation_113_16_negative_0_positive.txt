"Speaker A: 'I've been going through the compliance documents, and the governing law section seems overly complicated and challenging to navigate.' 

Speaker B: 'I agree. It often feels like each piece of legislation is layered with ambiguity, making jurisdiction questions unnecessarily complex.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It makes it tough for firms to ensure full compliance.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, though, identifying potential legal issues early on has become much more efficient with the new system.' 

Speaker A: 'Yes! The system's ability to flag potential risks has been impressive and helps us stay ahead of any problems.' 

Speaker B: 'It's definitely a game changer. I feel more confident about spotting issues before they escalate.'"
