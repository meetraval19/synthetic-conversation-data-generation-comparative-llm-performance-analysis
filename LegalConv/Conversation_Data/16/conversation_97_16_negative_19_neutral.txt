"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the potential challenges if we face a dispute.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, particularly when it comes to determining the right jurisdiction. That can get tricky and quite negative in outcomes sometimes.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, disputes can become complicated if different laws come into play.'

Speaker B: 'On a more practical note, have we identified our immediate action items?'

Speaker A: 'We have a few steps laid out, but we're still evaluating which ones to prioritize.'

Speaker B: 'A neutral plan can help, at least to ensure all bases are covered as we move forward.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. A systematic approach should minimize future issues with jurisdiction challenges.'"
