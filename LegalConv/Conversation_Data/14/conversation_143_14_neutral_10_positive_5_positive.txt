"Speaker A: 'So, let's start with selecting and preparing witnesses for your case. We'll focus on getting everyone comfortable with what to expect.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Is there anything specific we should do to get the witnesses ready?'

Speaker A: 'We’ll go through their statements thoroughly, but it’s mostly about making them feel at ease.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding communication with opposing parties, everything has been quite constructive so far. They seem open to discussions, which is a good sign.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. I was worried it might be confrontational.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely not. We’re keeping it professional and productive.'

Speaker B: 'Great, that’s a relief. What about the timeline for the case? Are we making progress?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we’re on track. All key dates have been set, and everything is moving smoothly. The process has been efficient.'

Speaker B: 'I’m glad to hear that. I was concerned about potential delays.'

Speaker A: 'No need to worry. We’ll keep everything on schedule. I’ll keep you updated regularly.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you for making everything clear. I feel more at ease now.'"
