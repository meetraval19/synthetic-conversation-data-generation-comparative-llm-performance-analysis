"Speaker A: 'We need to start by considering who might be best for shedding light on the case without swaying too strongly in any direction.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It's essential to remain impartial when selecting witnesses, ensuring they can communicate the facts accurately.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Once we have that settled, let's explore how mediation might benefit our clients.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, mediation offers a more collaborative approach and often saves time and resources. It's a favorite among our clients lately.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and it tends to preserve relationships which is an added bonus.'

Speaker B: 'Now, diving into reviewing those contracts... some of the terms seem overly complicated and not in our client's best interests.'

Speaker A: 'I noticed that too. There's too much ambiguity, which could lead to major disputes if not addressed immediately.'

Speaker B: 'We should definitely consider recommending some amendments to make everything clearer and more equitable for all parties involved.'"
