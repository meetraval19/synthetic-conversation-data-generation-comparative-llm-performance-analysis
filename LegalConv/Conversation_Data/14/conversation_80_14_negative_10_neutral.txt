"Speaker A: 'We've had a challenging time with preparing our key witnesses for the upcoming trial.'

Speaker B: 'I heard there were some issues with their testimonies not aligning. That must be causing some concern.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's been a bit of a setback. We're working diligently to ensure consistency, but it's proving difficult.'

Speaker B: 'On the communication side, how are things going with the opposing parties?'

Speaker A: 'It's been stable, not much to report honestly. Emails and messages have been straightforward so far.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. It can sometimes be unpredictable.'

Speaker A: 'True, but I'm hoping that predictability continues as we move closer to the trial.'

Speaker B: 'Let's hope so. At least it gives us one less thing to worry about for now.'"
