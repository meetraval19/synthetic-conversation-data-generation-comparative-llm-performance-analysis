Speaker B: 'Sure, it seems straightforward, neither party has raised major concerns about the witnesses.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, it's more about ensuring they're comfortable and well-informed rather than contentious.'

Speaker B: 'Now, let's delve into what the client actually wants from this negotiation. They've been quite adamant, haven't they?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, they have some lofty expectations, but realistically, aligning their goals with what we can achieve might be challenging.'

Speaker B: 'It’s tough when they’re holding onto outcomes that may not be attainable.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It’s about managing their expectations without disappointing them.'

Speaker B: 'That brings us to the draft agreements. Have you had a chance to look over the revisions?'

Speaker A: 'I did, and honestly, I’m not too pleased with them. It feels like we've hit some roadblocks.'

Speaker B: 'The inconsistencies are difficult to overlook, and it's creating friction.'

Speaker A: 'It seems we need a tighter approach to refine these documents as soon as possible.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, we’ll need another round of reviews to make this seamless.'
