"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about the challenges we’re facing with witness selection. Our options seem quite limited.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Preparing the witnesses is proving to be more difficult than anticipated, which could weaken our position.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and any lack of preparation might have serious implications in court.'

Speaker B: 'On a different note, have you reviewed the latest risk assessments?'

Speaker A: 'I have. It seems balanced for now, but we should remain vigilant as unexpected issues could arise.'

Speaker B: 'True, maintaining neutrality in our approach will help us adjust smoothly to any changes.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We should continue to monitor any developments closely as part of our strategy.'"
