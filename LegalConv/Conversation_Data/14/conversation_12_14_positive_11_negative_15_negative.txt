"Speaker A: 'The preparation with our witnesses has been going really well. I think they're poised to make a strong impression on the jury.'

Speaker B: 'That's fantastic to hear. A confident witness can really turn the tide in our favor.'

Speaker C: 'I agree. Now, about the cost projections... the estimates are climbing higher than we anticipated, and it's becoming a concern.'

Speaker A: 'I noticed that too. We might need to reassess some areas to avoid overshooting our budget.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and it's crucial we stay within limits, or it could affect our strategy in the long run.'

Speaker C: 'Speaking of strategy, the legal arguments are also proving challenging. Some aspects aren’t holding as much weight as we hoped.'

Speaker A: 'It seems we need to revisit certain points. Strengthening our case is priority.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, let's identify weaker arguments and refine them. We need our case to be robust and persuasive.'

Speaker C: 'I’ll schedule a review session for us to tackle these issues. The sooner, the better.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, let's maintain our momentum with the witness preparation and address these concerns head-on.'"
