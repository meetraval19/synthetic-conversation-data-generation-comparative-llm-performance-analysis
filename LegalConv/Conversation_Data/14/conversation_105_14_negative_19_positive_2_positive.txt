"Speaker A: 'I'm worried about our current pool for witness selection. They seem a bit underprepared for questioning.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. We need to ensure they can handle cross-examinations without faltering.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We should schedule more preparation sessions with them, maybe work on their confidence in delivering responses.'

Speaker B: 'Good idea. On the bright side, our action plan for the next steps is looking solid. The team's really come together to outline everything clearly.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the timeline is efficient, and everyone's tasks are well-defined. We should stay ahead of schedule.'

Speaker B: 'And as for the legal framework, things are looking favorable. We've got all the relevant laws and regulations on our side.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. Our research has covered every angle, so we should be in a strong position as we move forward.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's keep the momentum going and address any gaps we find.'"
