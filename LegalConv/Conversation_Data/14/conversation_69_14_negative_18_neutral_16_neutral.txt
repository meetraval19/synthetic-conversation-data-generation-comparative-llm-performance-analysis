"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our strategy for preparing witnesses, and it's worrying. The selection process seems quite chaotic right now.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. We need a more structured approach; otherwise, it might undermine our case.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We should address this before moving forward. Now, regarding the enforcement of terms, do you think there’s anything specific that needs attention?'

Speaker B: 'I’d say the implementation timeline might bring up some challenges, but nothing too concerning. It’s manageable with detailed planning.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, as long as we stay proactive, it shouldn’t be a major issue. How do you feel about the clauses on governing law and jurisdiction?'

Speaker B: 'They seem clear enough. I haven’t found any potential conflicts there.'

Speaker A: 'Same here. As long as all parties remain in agreement, this part should hold smoothly.'"
