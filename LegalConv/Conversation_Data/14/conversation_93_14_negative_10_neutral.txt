"Speaker A: 'The witness lineup for the trial is causing some stress. We've had difficulties ensuring they're fully prepared for cross-examination.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been challenging. Their inconsistencies might be problematic, and I’m concerned about how that could impact our case.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to find a way to work on their confidence and make sure their testimonies remain consistent. Maybe another prep session is necessary.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good plan. Now, regarding our interactions with the opposing parties, how do you think that's going?'

Speaker A: 'Honestly, it's been quite neutral. Their responses have been straightforward, and there haven't been any unexpected moves on their part.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. It's been civil and predictable so far, which is somewhat relieving given the circumstances.'

Speaker A: 'Let's hope it stays that way, at least until we resolve the issues with the witness prep.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We’ll tackle each challenge as it comes.'"
