"Speaker A: 'I'm concerned about getting our witnesses ready for the trial. Some seem nervous and unsure about their testimonies.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. We definitely need to focus more on preparing them to ensure consistency and confidence.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, our timeline is looking solid. We've met all the key dates and deadlines without any hiccups.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, sticking to the schedule has been a relief. It’s good to know that side of our preparation is on track.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s circle back to the witnesses then. Perhaps a few more mock sessions could help.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. If we can boost their confidence, everything else should fall into place smoothly.'"
