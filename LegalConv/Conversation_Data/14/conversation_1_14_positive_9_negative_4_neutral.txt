"Speaker A: 'I’m really pleased with the progress we’ve made on selecting and preparing our witnesses. Their testimonies are shaping up strongly.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, their confidence in deposition simulations has been impressive. It’s set to strengthen our case significantly.'

Speaker A: 'On the downside, the review of those contractual terms has been challenging. There are a few clauses that could really complicate our argument.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Some of the language is ambiguous, and it might not hold up well under scrutiny.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll need to focus on clarifying those areas before the next hearing. It’s critical to mitigate any issues that could arise.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We should also ensure everything remains confidential and falls under privilege.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. It’s crucial we maintain strict confidentiality to protect our strategy discussions.'

Speaker B: 'I’ll reiterate the importance of confidentiality in tomorrow’s briefing. Consistency is key, after all.' 

Speaker A: 'Let’s be sure everyone is on the same page. The integrity of our case depends on it.'"
