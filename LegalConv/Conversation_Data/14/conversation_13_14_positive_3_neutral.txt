"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how our witness preparation is going. They seem confident and ready for the stand.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! A well-prepared witness can make all the difference in a case.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We’ve focused on making them comfortable with the process and the likely questions.'

Speaker B: 'Good strategy. Now, shifting gears a bit, have we done a thorough assessment of the potential legal risks involved?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we have. The initial review shows a fairly straightforward case, but we’re keeping an eye on all angles.'

Speaker B: 'That’s sensible. Even with low-risk cases, it's always wise to stay vigilant.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We're prepared to adapt if anything unexpected comes up during the trial.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds like you have everything well under control.'"
