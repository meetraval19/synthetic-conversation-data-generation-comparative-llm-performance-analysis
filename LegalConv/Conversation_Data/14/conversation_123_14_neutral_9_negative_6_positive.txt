Speaker B: 'Certainly. It's crucial that we present their statements clearly to avoid any discrepancies.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, regarding the contract language—several clauses seem open to multiple interpretations.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve noticed the same. Some terms need significant revision to ensure clarity and avoid potential disputes.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll definitely need to work on that. On a brighter note, I’ve gone through the documents and evidence submitted.'

Speaker B: 'And?'

Speaker A: 'They're comprehensive and strongly support our position. This will definitely strengthen our negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Securing solid evidence is always a relief.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let's make sure everything is presented effectively to strengthen our case even further.'"
