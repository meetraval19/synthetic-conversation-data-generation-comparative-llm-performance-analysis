"Speaker A: 'I think we have a strong chance with the selection of witnesses. Our main witness has firsthand experience and seems very credible.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and the way they've been prepared, they should handle cross-examination smoothly. It's reassuring to see their confidence in our mock trials.'

Speaker A: 'On the other hand, I'm a bit concerned about the contractual terms we've reviewed. There are some clauses that seem problematic.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Some terms are quite ambiguous and could be interpreted against us. We need to address these before the opposition does.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to focus on procuring expert testimony to clarify those terms. It could strengthen our stance.'

Speaker B: 'That's a solid idea. It would definitely add weight to our interpretation of the contract. Let's prioritize that for our next steps.'"
