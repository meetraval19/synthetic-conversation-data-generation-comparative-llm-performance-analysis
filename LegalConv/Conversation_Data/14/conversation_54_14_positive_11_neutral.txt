"Speaker A: 'I’ve been really pleased with how our witness interviews have gone. Their preparation seems solid and confident, which is crucial for the upcoming trial.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, their ability to present information clearly is a huge advantage for us. It seems like the selection process was spot on.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the team did an excellent job in vetting and preparing them. It’s always reassuring to have strong witnesses to support our case.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, have you had a chance to review the financials for next quarter’s cases?'

Speaker A: 'I have. The cost estimates are quite straightforward, I’d say. We’re neither over nor under budget at the moment.'

Speaker B: 'That’s good to hear. I was concerned there might be unexpected expenses, but it seems like we’re in a stable position financially.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, we’ll need to keep monitoring things closely, but I think the budget planning has been fairly accurate so far.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect. Let’s continue keeping everything on track. A solid combination of preparation and careful budgeting should serve us well.'"
