"Speaker A: 'I must say, the process of selecting our witnesses has gone exceptionally well. Their testimonies should really strengthen our case.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The preparation sessions have been very productive, and they seem confident and articulate.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, their ability to clearly convey the facts will definitely have a positive impact on the jury.'

Speaker B: 'On a less positive note, though, I'm worried about our budget constraints. The cost estimates for this case are higher than anticipated.'

Speaker A: 'I know, and it's been quite a challenge to align our strategies within the financial limitations. The unexpected expenses are a real concern.'

Speaker B: 'Maybe we should re-evaluate some areas to minimize costs without compromising the quality of our preparations.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a plan. Weâ€™ll have to be meticulous to ensure everything is covered efficiently.'"
