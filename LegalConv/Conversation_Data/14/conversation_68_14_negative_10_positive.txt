"Speaker A: 'I'm really concerned about the witness selection for this case. It's been a challenge ensuring everyone is prepared and consistent with their testimonies.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It can be quite stressful when witnesses aren't as ready as we'd like them to be. Maybe we should consider additional prep sessions?'

Speaker A: 'That's a good idea. It might help alleviate some of the issues we're facing. On a brighter note, our communication with the opposing parties has been surprisingly smooth.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's refreshing. Their willingness to engage constructively is making things much easier on our side.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's rare to have such positivity in communications, so it's a nice change of pace.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It's good to find common ground, despite the difficulties with the witness preparation.'

Speaker A: 'Letâ€™s focus on the positives where we can. Hopefully, this will help us move forward successfully.'"
