"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about our current situation with finding the right people to testify.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It’s been a challenge to ensure they’re well-prepared and reliable.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, their testimonies could make or break our case, and I don’t feel confident about it.'

Speaker B: 'Maybe we should review our options one more time. It might give us better clarity.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a plan. On another note, how do you feel about our overall approach to the case?'

Speaker B: 'I’d say it’s shaping up quite well. We’ve covered most of our bases.'

Speaker A: 'True, but there’s always room for adjustment if needed.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, staying flexible will be key to adapting to any changes down the line.'"
