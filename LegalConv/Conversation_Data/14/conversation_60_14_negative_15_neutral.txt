"Speaker A: 'We've been reviewing our approach to selecting and preparing witnesses for the upcoming trial.'

Speaker B: 'I know. It’s been quite challenging. Some potential witnesses aren’t as cooperative as we’d hoped.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and their testimonies might not hold up well under cross-examination.'

Speaker B: 'That’s worrying. We really need to be strategic about who we choose to testify.'

Speaker A: 'On a different note, our team’s been discussing our legal arguments.'

Speaker B: 'How’s that going?'

Speaker A: 'It’s progressing. We’ve narrowed down the key points, but it’s still a work in progress.'

Speaker B: 'I suppose it will need refining as we gather more information.'

Speaker A: 'Correct, but overall, I'm feeling cautiously optimistic about the angle we’re pursuing.'"
