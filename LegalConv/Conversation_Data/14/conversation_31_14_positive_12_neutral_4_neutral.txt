Speaker A: 'Precisely. We are in a good position to meet those requirements without much deviation.'

Speaker B: 'And in terms of our private communications, how can we ensure they remain secure?'

Speaker A: 'That’s an important aspect. Our communications will be protected under the lawyer-client privilege, and we adhere strictly to confidentiality protocols.'
