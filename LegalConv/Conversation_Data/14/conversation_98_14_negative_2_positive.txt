Speaker B: 'I agree. We should be careful about the impression they might leave. Maybe additional preparation sessions could help?'

Speaker A: 'That could work, but it might not be enough to change their impact on the jury.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, I've been reviewing the latest amendments in the regulations relevant to our case.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Any particular laws stand out?'

Speaker B: 'Perfect. Leveraging those can really give us an edge.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We should focus on building our argument around those updates.'

Speaker B: 'Let's do that. It could be pivotal for us.'"
