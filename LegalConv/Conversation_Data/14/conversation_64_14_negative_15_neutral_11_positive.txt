"Speaker A: 'So, are we having any issues with selecting the right witnesses for the upcoming trial?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, yes. There's been a lot of difficulty in finding credible witnesses who are willing to testify. It's been quite frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'That's concerning. We need to ensure they're well prepared, too. A shaky testimony won't help our case.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It’s adding more stress, knowing we might not have them ready in time.'

Speaker C: 'On another note, how's the development of our legal arguments coming along?'

Speaker A: 'It's progressing steadily. There are a few points that still need refining, but overall, it’s shaping up. We’ll need to stay unbiased and look at it from all angles.'

Speaker C: 'That's good to hear. It’s important that we maintain clarity in our arguments to avoid any possible challenges from the opposing side.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. How about the cost estimates and budget for this case?'

Speaker C: 'Actually, that’s been the bright spot. We managed to negotiate a few deals, keeping the expenses well within our initial plans.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a relief! Having the budget under control gives us some breathing space to focus more on the case itself.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let's continue pushing forward, making sure everything aligns well before we step into the courtroom.'"
