"Speaker A: 'I understand you're concerned about the upcoming trial. Let's start with how we'll approach preparing our witnesses.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I'm curious about what that entails.'

Speaker A: 'It's a pretty straightforward process. We'll ensure they are well-versed in their testimony and feel comfortable with what to expect during questioning.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. I appreciate the clarity.'

Speaker A: 'Now, onto our overall legal strategy. I must be honest, there are some challenges with the current plan.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, why is that?'

Speaker A: 'The evidence we have is not as strong as I'd like, and there could be complications in court.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds concerning. Is there a way to adjust our approach?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we can pivot and focus on areas where we have more leverage. It may take some creative maneuvering, but it's doable.'

Speaker B: 'I see. Thank you for being upfront with me. I trust your judgment to navigate these complexities.'

Speaker A: 'I'm committed to providing the best support possible, and we'll do everything we can to strengthen our position.'"
