"Speaker A: 'Let's start with discussing how selecting and preparing the witnesses has been going. It seems like things are moving positively in that area.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the witnesses feel confident and well-prepared. That's a big step in the right direction.'

Speaker C: 'I'm glad to hear that. Now, about the laws and regulations relevant to our case, how are we doing in that regard?'

Speaker A: 'We are on solid ground. The legal framework is straightforward, so no major surprises there.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's all quite standard. Just ensuring all our bases are covered legally.'

Speaker C: 'That's reassuring. However, I must express some concerns about the current state of our evidence and document review.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, there have been delays in the document review process, which is quite frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been challenging. Some documents were harder to obtain, and reviewing them has taken more time than anticipated.'

Speaker C: 'Let's focus on finding a way to expedite this process without compromising on thoroughness. How does that sound?'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a good plan. We'll need to allocate some more resources perhaps.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, discussing resource allocation seems like the right step forward. Itâ€™s important to tackle this effectively.'

Speaker C: 'Great. Let's keep up the momentum. Despite the challenges, we're making progress.'"
