"Speaker A: 'I'm really concerned about the challenges with finding the right individuals to testify. It's been tough getting them prepared for what's ahead.'

Speaker B: 'I completely understand. Witnesses can sometimes be unpredictable, and it adds a layer of uncertainty to our case.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and ensuring they are well-versed in what to testify can be daunting.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, I've been reviewing the recent updates in our sector's regulations, and things are looking favorable for our stance.'

Speaker A: 'That's a relief. Clear and supportive laws can really strengthen our position in the argument.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It's great to have that backing; it gives us more confidence as we proceed.'

Speaker A: 'Yeah, having a strong legal framework helps offset some of the stress with the witnesses. We'll need to rely heavily on that.'

Speaker B: 'For sure, understanding those laws inside and out is crucial. At least in that area, we're on solid ground.'"
