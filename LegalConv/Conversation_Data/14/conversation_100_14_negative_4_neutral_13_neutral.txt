"Speaker A: 'Let's start with the witness selection. It seems there have been some challenges during preparation.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, the witnesses haven't been as cooperative as we'd hoped, which is causing some concern.'

Speaker A: 'I understand how that can complicate the process. Moving on, we should discuss confidentiality in this context.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. It's crucial that we maintain confidentiality. I think we both agree on its importance in these proceedings.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We need to ensure that privilege is respected at all times.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Now, when it comes to settlement options, there are several strategies we could consider.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, and it seems exploring those strategies without any bias might be the best approach.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. We can weigh the pros and cons of each option together.'
