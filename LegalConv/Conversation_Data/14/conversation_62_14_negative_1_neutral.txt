Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Hopefully, we can work through their hesitation. It’s crucial they feel confident.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let’s focus on some re-assurance strategies before the trial.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, have we fully grasped what our client’s main priorities are for this case?'
