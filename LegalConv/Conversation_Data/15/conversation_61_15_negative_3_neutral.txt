"Speaker A: 'Lately, I've noticed that crafting arguments seems to have become more challenging.'  

Speaker B: 'I agree. The unpredictability in courtroom decisions makes it tough to anticipate outcomes.'  

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and that uncertainty can lead to increased stress and pressure when formulating these arguments.'  

Speaker B: 'True, but on the other hand, when it comes to assessing legal risks, it's not as volatile.'  

Speaker A: 'Yes, evaluating risks usually involves set parameters. It’s more about following a methodical approach.'  

Speaker B: 'Indeed, it’s systematic. Still, it requires staying updated with new regulations, which is crucial.'
