"Speaker A: 'We need to refine our strategy. The formulation of arguments hasn't been as strong as we'd hoped.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, the arguments presented so far are not as compelling as they should be.'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on what we can control. We've established a positive timeline, and we're hitting all the key dates efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, maintaining that timeline gives us a real advantage. It's definitely a positive aspect of our negotiation.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding resolution options, I think exploring mediation or arbitration could be quite beneficial.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, those options appear promising and could lead to a satisfactory settlement sooner rather than later.'"
