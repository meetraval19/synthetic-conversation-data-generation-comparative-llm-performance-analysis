"Speaker A: 'I'm worried about our legal argument formulation for this case. We've hit a couple of snags.'

Speaker B: 'I hear you. It's been challenging refining those arguments. We'll need a fresh perspective to untangle it.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Perhaps bringing in an external consultant could help us see things differently.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Now, regarding our cost estimates, let's make sure we align with the budget.'

Speaker A: 'I've reviewed the numbers, and everything seems to be on track, but we should keep monitoring it.'

Speaker B: 'Good. We'll keep an eye out for any unexpected expenses.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a brighter note, I'm really optimistic about our witness selection and preparation.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, our key witnesses are strong, and their testimonies should reinforce our position nicely.'

Speaker A: 'They've been rehearsed thoroughly, and their confidence is a great sign.'

Speaker B: 'I'm confident their input will give us the edge we need.'"
