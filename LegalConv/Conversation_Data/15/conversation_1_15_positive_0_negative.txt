Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the way our team collaborated to formulate those points was impressive. It's setting us up well for the upcoming trial.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad you think so. However, I'm a bit concerned about a potential oversight on one underlying issue. It could be problematic if not addressed.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It seems like a complex challenge that we didn't fully anticipate.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, itâ€™s unfortunate that it emerged so late in the process. We'll need to brainstorm some solutions.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Despite this hiccup, our overall approach and argument foundation is quite robust, which is encouraging.'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on mitigating the issue. With a strong argument base, we're already ahead, and we can definitely overcome this.'"
