Speaker A: 'What about drafting and reviewing the documents? I find it incredibly tedious and often frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. There always seem to be endless revisions, and it's easy to miss minor errors that can cause bigger issues.'

Speaker A: 'That’s why staying up to date with regulations is crucial, even though it’s a daunting task.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, but necessary to ensure compliance.'
