"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about the way some legal arguments are being formulated in the draft.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. The language does seem a bit confrontational, which might complicate matters.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It feels a bit rigid, which doesn't foster collaboration.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s shift focus to the terms themselves. I think we’ve laid out the obligations and rights fairly clearly.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It’s a straightforward task. Now, on to the evidence and documents. The comprehensive review has been quite impressive, hasn’t it?'
