"Speaker A: 'I believe our approach to crafting the argument is strong. We've identified key precedents that should give us an advantage.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the way we’ve outlined the main points is compelling and should resonate well in court.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Now, about the resources needed for this case...'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, the budget is a concern. The estimations for the expert witnesses are higher than expected.'

Speaker A: 'That is worrisome. We’ll need to re-evaluate and find areas where we can cut costs without compromising the case.'

Speaker B: 'I think focusing on essential testimony could trim expenses. We might also explore less costly options for certain services.'

Speaker A: 'Right, but we should keep the effectiveness of our argument in mind. A strong foundation will help justify any essential costs.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. Balancing cost while ensuring a solid case is our top priority. It’s a challenge, but we can manage it.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's keep refining both the argument and the budget to ensure everything aligns.'”
