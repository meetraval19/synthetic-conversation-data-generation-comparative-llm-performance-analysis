"Speaker A: 'We've been struggling a bit with the angles for our argument. The initial formulation hasn't held up as well as we hoped.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It feels like we're facing more pushback than expected. We might need to rethink some strategies to make a stronger case.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's look at previous cases for potential improvements. For now, should we discuss the schedule to keep everything on track?'

Speaker B: 'Sure. The timeline is critical. We’ve got to ensure we meet all the upcoming deadlines, especially since the deposition dates are just around the corner.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I believe the pre-trial motions are due next month. We need to stay focused on these key dates to avoid last-minute hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'Right. Staying on top of these will alleviate some pressure. Let’s keep the team informed and handle each step with care.'"
