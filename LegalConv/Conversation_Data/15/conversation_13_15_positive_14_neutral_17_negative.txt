"Speaker A: 'I must say, crafting the legal arguments for this case has been quite rewarding. It's remarkable how well the points are coming together.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, the argument formulation is indeed strong. Now, moving on, how do you feel about who we're considering to testify?'

Speaker A: 'Honestly, I think the choices are balanced. Each potential witness brings something valuable, though it seems quite routine in terms of preparation.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. We’ll have to ensure they're well-prepared, but at least it’s straightforward. However, I'm a bit more concerned about the documents.'

Speaker A: 'I get that. Reviewing these legal documents has been quite challenging. There are inconsistencies that might cause issues.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It's crucial that we address these errors before they become a problem. It does feel rather burdensome at times.' 

Speaker A: 'We'll just have to double our efforts there. The argument is our strong suit, so we can't let the documents undermine it.'

Speaker B: 'Right. At the end of the day, a solid argument will make all the difference.'"
