"Speaker A: 'I'm really struggling with this formulation phase. It feels like no matter how we shape our argument, there are too many holes.'

Speaker B: 'I understand the frustration. Sometimes it feels like crafting the perfect argument is an uphill battle, especially with how unpredictable the outcomes can be.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It seems like for every solution, a new issue pops up.'

Speaker B: 'On a more neutral note, let's review the key issues again to see if there's something we've overlooked.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. Identifying the main issues might give us a fresh perspective, even if it doesn't feel very groundbreaking right now.'

Speaker B: 'Right. Sometimes just clearing up those points without worrying too much about the argumentation can open up new paths.'

Speaker A: 'True. Maybe breaking down everything one step at a time will help, or at least make the task feel less overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let's focus on clarity first, then refine our arguments further.'"
