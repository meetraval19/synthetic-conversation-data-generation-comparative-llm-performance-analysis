Speaker B: 'Yes, I understand it involves several steps but doesn’t seem overly complicated, right?'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. The process can be straightforward, though it depends on the specifics.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, but I've heard that the timeline for these processes can be tricky. Is that true?'
