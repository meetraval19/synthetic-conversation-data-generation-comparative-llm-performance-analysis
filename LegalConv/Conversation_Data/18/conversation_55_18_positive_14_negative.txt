"Speaker A: 'I've been quite impressed with how enforcement strategies have evolved recently. It seems like there's a stronger foundation in place now.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the implementation has certainly become more efficient, which makes compliance smoother across the board.'

Speaker A: 'On the flip side, have you noticed challenges with selecting and preparing witnesses? It feels like that area hasn't progressed as much.'
