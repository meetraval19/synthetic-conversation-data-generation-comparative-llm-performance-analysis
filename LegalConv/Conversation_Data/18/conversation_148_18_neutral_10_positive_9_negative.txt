Speaker B: 'It seems straightforward, although the implementation could have some complexities.'

Speaker A: 'True. I suppose we’ll have to be adaptable during the process.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. On another note, how is communication with the other side going?'

Speaker A: 'Surprisingly well. They've been quite cooperative, and it’s fostering a much smoother dialogue than anticipated.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. It always helps when the other party is responsive and understanding.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It makes focusing on the bigger picture much easier. Now, have you had a chance to look at the fine print of the contracts?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and there are a few areas of concern. Some clauses seem unnecessarily restrictive.'

Speaker A: 'I was worried about that. We should prioritize addressing those issues during our review.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We'll need to ensure any problematic terms are clarified or adjusted to avoid future complications.'

Speaker A: 'Let's make sure we bring this up in our next meeting. It's crucial to iron out these concerns before moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Of course, ensuring clarity on all fronts will be key to avoiding any future disputes.'"
