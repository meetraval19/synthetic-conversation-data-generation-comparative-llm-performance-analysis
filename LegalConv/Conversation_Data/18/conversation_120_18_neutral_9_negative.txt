"Speaker A: 'Let's start with the enforcement and implementation aspects of the agreement. It's crucial to ensure both parties understand the procedures.'  
Speaker B: 'I agree. It's important to have clarity so neither side feels uncertain during execution.'  
Speaker A: 'Exactly. Having a clear process will help if any issues arise, keeping things smooth.'  
Speaker B: 'Now, moving to the review of the terms, there are a few areas of concern.'  
Speaker A: 'Yes, some of the clauses seem a bit restrictive. I can see how they might cause friction.'  
Speaker B: 'That's what I'm worried about. We need terms that work for both parties, without any undue burden.'  
Speaker A: 'Perhaps we should explore some adjustments to make things more balanced. That might resolve these concerns.'  
Speaker B: 'I think that's a good idea. A bit of flexibility could go a long way in finalizing the contract.'  
Speaker A: 'Let's make those changes and see if it aligns better with both our expectations.'"
