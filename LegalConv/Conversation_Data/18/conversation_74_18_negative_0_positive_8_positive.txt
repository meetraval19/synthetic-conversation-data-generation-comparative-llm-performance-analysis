"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our progress on identifying the challenges, and I believe we're doing well in pinpointing potential legal issues early on.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, refining our ability to spot those issues has been crucial in avoiding bigger problems down the line.'

Speaker A: 'However, there's still a concern with enforcement and implementation. Things seem to be stalling more often than they should.'

Speaker B: 'That's true, and the repeated delays are frustrating. It seems like each solution faces a new hurdle.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, I'm optimistic about the new resolution strategies we've been exploring.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, those options are promising. Mediation, in particular, seems to be a less adversarial approach, which is helpful.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, and some clients find it more agreeable than the traditional litigation route.'

Speaker B: 'Hopefully, as we continue refining our strategies, we'll address enforcement issues more effectively.'
