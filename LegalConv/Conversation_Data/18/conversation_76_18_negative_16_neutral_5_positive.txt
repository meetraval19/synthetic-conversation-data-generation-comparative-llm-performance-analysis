"Speaker A: 'We've been encountering several obstacles recently, particularly with getting the orders enforced effectively.'

Speaker B: 'It's been challenging; the implementation of these orders isn't going as smoothly as we'd hoped. What are some of the main barriers you're seeing?'

Speaker A: 'Mainly resource constraints and varying levels of cooperation among stakeholders. It's really slowing us down.'

Speaker B: 'Understandable, but does this impact the timeline we initially set?'

Speaker A: 'Actually, despite those hurdles, we've been able to stick closely to our key dates. The team has really pushed hard to meet the deadlines.'

Speaker B: 'That's impressive! Speaking of which, has there been any change in the conditions around where the case is being heard?'

Speaker A: 'No significant changes. The current jurisdiction and applicable laws are still in play, and everything there seems stable.'

Speaker B: 'Good to hear there's some consistency. So, what's next on the list with these timelines looking positive?'

Speaker A: 'We're currently ahead of schedule, aiming to finalize a few more elements by next month.' 

Speaker B: 'Great, keeping proactive should help when addressing those enforcement hurdles. Weâ€™re prepared to assist wherever needed.'"
