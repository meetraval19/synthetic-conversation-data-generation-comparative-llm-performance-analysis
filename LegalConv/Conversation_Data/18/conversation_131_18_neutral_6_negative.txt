"Speaker A: 'I'm considering moving forward with a new patent. What do you think are the main challenges I might face with enforcing it?'

Speaker B: 'Enforcement can be tricky. It often involves navigating a lot of legal nuances and ensuring proper documentation is in place.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds pretty standard. Is there anything specific I should be concerned about?'

Speaker B: 'In terms of enforcement, it's usually neutral ground. You just need to ensure everything is implemented correctly to strengthen your position.'
