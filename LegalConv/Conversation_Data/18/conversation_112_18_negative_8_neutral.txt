"Speaker A: 'One thing we need to address is how past enforcement and implementation have been problematic in similar agreements.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. We've encountered a lot of challenges ensuring compliance, and it's been quite frustrating for both parties.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and I think we should be more proactive in drafting clauses that prevent these issues from arising again.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but we also should consider flexible dispute resolution options. What are your thoughts on incorporating mediation as a first step?'

Speaker A: 'Mediation can be effective and might help resolve issues more amicably. It’s often less adversarial, which can be beneficial.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. It might also save time and costs for everyone involved. Perhaps we could outline specific conditions under which arbitration would be necessary?'

Speaker A: 'That seems like a practical approach. It provides a clear path if mediation doesn’t lead to resolution.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, having a structured process laid out should help all parties feel more secure.'"
