"Speaker A: 'I'm really optimistic about how the enforcement strategies are shaping up for this case. The new measures should close a lot of the loopholes we faced before.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it seems like we'll have a smoother path with these improvements in place. Now, regarding our witnesses, how are things looking on that front?'

Speaker A: 'Well, we've managed to shortlist some credible individuals. Their backgrounds align well with our argument, but making sure they're fully prepped will be crucial. It’s always a bit of a balancing act.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, and their preparation needs to be thorough given the dynamics of this case. It's crucial they stay composed during cross-examinations.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Now, I hate to bring this up, but our budget has been a bit of a sticking point. The cost projections are starting to get a little overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I’ve noticed. The numbers are not aligning well with our initial estimates, which is concerning. We might need to revisit some elements of the strategy to keep expenses manageable.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. If we can streamline some processes without affecting quality, it might help balance things out. Let’s schedule a detailed review of the budget soon.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a good idea. We need to ensure we’re not overspending while still delivering strong results. It’s a tricky balance for sure.'"
