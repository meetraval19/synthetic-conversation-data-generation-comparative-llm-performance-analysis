"Speaker A: 'Thanks for meeting with me today. I've been concerned about the way rules are sometimes applied inconsistently. It seems like enforcement and implementation can be quite unpredictable at times.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It can really depend on the context and specific circumstances, so it's important to stay informed about any updates or changes.'

Speaker A: 'Right, but I'm hoping to focus on how these variables might present opportunities. Is there a way to conduct a legal risk assessment that optimizes our position?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! A thorough risk assessment can highlight potential advantages and help us prepare proactive strategies. It's a very positive step towards safeguarding your interests.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring to hear. However, I'm also thinking about the legal documents we need to prepare. The previous experiences with drafting and reviewing them have been quite stressful.'

Speaker A: 'Thanks, I really appreciate your help in navigating these challenges.'
