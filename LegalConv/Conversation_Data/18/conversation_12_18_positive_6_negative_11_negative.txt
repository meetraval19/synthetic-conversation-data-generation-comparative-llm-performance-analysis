"Speaker A: 'I'm pleased with how well we're addressing potential enforcement challenges. It looks like our implementation strategy is robust this time.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it should provide a solid framework for both parties. However, I'm concerned about the document review process. There were significant discrepancies in the draft.'

Speaker A: 'I noticed that too. The inconsistencies could pose problems if not rectified soon.'

Speaker B: 'And then there's the budget situation. The cost projections are higher than anticipated, which may require revisiting the overall spend.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It's crucial to tighten the budget without affecting the quality of enforcement measures.'

Speaker B: 'We should prioritize revisiting cost allocation to ensure we don't exceed our financial limits.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, let’s plan a follow-up to address these issues comprehensively. Meanwhile, I’m glad the enforcement aspect is on the right path.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's ensure the rest aligns just as well with our goals.'"
