"Speaker A: 'Let's dive into the enforcement measures. We’ve seen some challenges in execution recently.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, those issues have been quite problematic. The last contract faced significant hurdles in that regard.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, which is why we need a tighter framework this time. We can't afford repeat setbacks.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Now, regarding how we approach settlements, what are your thoughts?'

Speaker A: 'Well, our strategy needs to be flexible. We should consider multiple options to see what aligns best with our objectives.'

Speaker B: 'Flexibility does seem wise. It allows us to adapt to any unforeseen developments without being too rigid.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Let's ensure these points are clearly outlined in the new contract draft.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. We’ll have to keep an eye on both areas to avoid any future complications.'"
