"Speaker A: 'Let's start by acknowledging the progress we've made identifying the core legal issues. It feels like we've really clarified the path forward.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, defining those issues accurately has been a great leap in resolving our disputes.'

Speaker A: 'That said, I'm concerned about the challenges we might face when it comes to enforcement and implementation. There were significant obstacles last time.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, those implementation hurdles were quite frustrating. We need a more robust strategy this time.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, about which legal framework to adhere to, I'm open to discussing options. It seems neutral ground might suit both parties.'

Speaker B: 'That's a fair point. Selecting a jurisdiction everyone finds acceptable could streamline the proceedings.'

Speaker A: 'As long as our focus remains on defining the legal issues clearly, I’m confident we’ll navigate through this effectively.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, ensuring those issues are well-defined really makes everything else more manageable.'"
