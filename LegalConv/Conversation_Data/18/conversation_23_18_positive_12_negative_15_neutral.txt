"Speaker A: 'I'm optimistic about the efforts we're putting into resolving the enforcement and implementation challenges. We've made significant progress recently.'

Speaker B: 'That's encouraging to hear. At least there's a clear path forward on that front.'

Speaker A: 'However, the compliance review has presented some hurdles. The regulators seem to have doubled down on the requirements.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, it feels like they're never fully satisfied, no matter the measures we take to comply. It's been quite frustrating to navigate.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it's been a tricky process. On the brighter side, our formulation of the legal argument is shaping up well. We have a solid foundation to work from.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the groundwork there seems pretty stable. It's important that we maintain a balanced and clear approach.'

Speaker A: 'For sure, clarity is key. It's all about presenting our position effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, and as long as we stick to the essentials, we should manage the proceedings without too many surprises.'"
