"Speaker A: 'Lately, I've been concerned about how enforcement is being handled. It's not always straightforward, is it?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the lack of clear guidelines can make implementation tricky and lead to some unwanted consequences.'

Speaker A: 'It's frustrating. The inconsistency really impacts the reliability of the whole system.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, and that unpredictability makes risk assessment a lot tougher.'

Speaker A: 'On a different note, have you seen the recent cost estimate reports?'

Speaker A: 'I thought the same. Although there's still room for improvement, it's more stable than before.'

Speaker B: 'True. Aligning budget planning with current needs is always a challenge, but it appears we're on the right track.'"
