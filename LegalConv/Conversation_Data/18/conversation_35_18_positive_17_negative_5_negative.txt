Speaker B: 'That's reassuring to hear. However, I’ve been having issues with the drafting and reviewing of legal documents. It feels like a constant uphill battle.'

Speaker A: 'I understand that. The complexity and attention to detail required can be overwhelming, especially if there are frequent revisions.'
