"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing our plan moving forward and the steps we can take to reach a resolution.' 

Speaker B: 'I agree, setting clear action items can really help both parties move in a positive direction.' 

Speaker A: 'Perfect. Now, about the documents you've submitted, we've found some discrepancies that might complicate things.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, the evidence review process tends to uncover some issues. It's not the best part of this, I admit.'

Speaker A: 'Glad we see eye to eye on that. Additionally, regarding the compliance checks, everything seems in order from our end.'

Speaker B: 'It's good to know the regulatory aspects didnâ€™t pose any hurdles. It keeps things straightforward, at least on that front.' 

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. So, let's reconvene next week with updates on those action items. Sound good?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that sounds like a great plan. Looking forward to resolving this positively.'"
