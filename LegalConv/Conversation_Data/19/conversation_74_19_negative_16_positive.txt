"Speaker A: 'I know we have a lot to cover today, but let's start with clarifying what's expected of everyone over the next few weeks. There seem to be some disagreements.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've noticed that defining who does what has been more challenging than anticipated. It's causing some frustration on my end.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It's definitely critical that we align on tasks moving forward to avoid any further setbacks.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Now, shifting to the legal specifics, I'm particularly pleased with how we’ve structured the choice of law and jurisdiction.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, selecting that jurisdiction provides us with a stable and predictable legal framework. It's quite reassuring.'

Speaker B: 'Having clarity in this area certainly gives us a firm foundation to resolve potential disputes efficiently.'

Speaker A: 'I couldn’t agree more. Now, if we could just sort out those action items, we'd be in excellent shape.'

Speaker B: 'Right, addressing those will really pave the way for smoother operations moving forward.'"
