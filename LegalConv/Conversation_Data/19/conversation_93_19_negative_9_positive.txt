“Speaker A: 'I know we're at a crucial point, but the way forward seems convoluted right now.'

Speaker B: 'I completely understand. Let's focus first on ironing out the main points of the agreement. I think our review of the terms was quite productive.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. The way we clarified those clauses should pave the way for smoother negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but I’m concerned about how the immediate actions needed for implementation are all tangled up.'

Speaker A: 'That's true. There's a lot to untangle regarding next steps. It feels like every time we resolve one issue, another pops up.'

Speaker B: 'It's frustrating, but maybe we can draft a simplified roadmap to tackle these tasks one by one.'

Speaker A: 'A manageable plan is crucial. Meanwhile, the fact that we've come to terms on the essentials makes this process worthwhile.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The positive discussions around those terms give me hope that we're on the right track.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. Let’s focus on maintaining that momentum while we navigate these more challenging aspects.'”
