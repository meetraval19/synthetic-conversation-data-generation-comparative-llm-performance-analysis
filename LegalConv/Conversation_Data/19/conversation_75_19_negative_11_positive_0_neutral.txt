Speaker B: 'I agree, it's not an easy task, and there seem to be some significant hurdles. It's crucial we handle this delicately.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a brighter note, our cost estimates for the settlement are looking quite favorable.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! Having a clear budget plan helps us proceed with much more confidence.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. It gives us a solid foundation to negotiate from. How are we doing with pinpointing the core legal issues?'

Speaker A: 'As long as we keep identifying them methodically, we'll be in a strong position moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Let's keep pushing on that front, even if the next steps seem tricky at the moment.'"
