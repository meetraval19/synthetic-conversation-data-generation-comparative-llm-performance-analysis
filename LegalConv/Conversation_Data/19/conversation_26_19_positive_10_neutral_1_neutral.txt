"Speaker A: 'It's great to see we've outlined clear action items. These steps will really drive our negotiation forward.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a structured plan gives us a solid foundation. Now, about coordinating contact with the other side, how do you propose we approach them?'

Speaker A: 'I think maintaining an open yet professional tone is key. Our main goal is to keep the communication neutral and focused on objectives.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, that should help prevent any misunderstandings. Speaking of, have we thoroughly aligned our strategy with the client's main priorities?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we've ensured that their goals are consistently reflected in every proposal draft. It's neutral ground for now, but we can make adjustments if needed.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect, balancing their objectives with our negotiation strategy is crucial. Let's keep that momentum going.'"
