Speaker B: 'Yes, those lingering items have been quite challenging. They seem to be delaying everything.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Addressing them is crucial, but on a positive note, we've made great progress with the documents and evidence. It all looks solid.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the thorough review was impressive. It's reassuring to have clarity in that area.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, but until we sort out those other issues, finalizing anything feels premature.'

Speaker B: 'True, it's frustrating, but staying focused on the documentation has been a relief.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, our work there has really strengthened our position for the negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Let's keep pushing to resolve the remaining challenges, even if they are a bit of a headache right now.'"
