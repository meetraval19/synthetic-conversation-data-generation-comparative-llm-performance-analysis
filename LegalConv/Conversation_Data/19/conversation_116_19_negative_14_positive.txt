"Speaker A: 'So, about the outcomes from the last meeting – it feels like we've hit a snag with setting up our action plan.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, implementing those steps is proving to be a bit more challenging than we initially thought. The timelines are really tight.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and some team members are still unclear about their roles, which makes the whole process frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'Let's try to re-evaluate and see how we can streamline the next steps. Moving on, have you thought about witness preparation?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, that part is coming together nicely. The witnesses are quite cooperative and willing to participate.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! Choosing them carefully really seems to be paying off. It’s crucial they feel well-prepared and confident.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, their testimony could be pivotal, and they seem comfortable with the preparation materials.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Let’s focus on refining their statements, so they’re ready for any kind of questioning.'

Speaker A: 'With their enthusiasm and your guidance, I think we're in a strong position for that aspect of the process.'"
