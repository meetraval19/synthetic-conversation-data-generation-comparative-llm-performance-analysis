Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been frustrating trying to outline clear action items. The uncertainty is problematic, and we need a better approach to keep everything moving.'

Speaker B: 'True, but I wish the path forward on our own side was clearer.' 

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, finding a way to solidify those steps is crucial going forward.'"
