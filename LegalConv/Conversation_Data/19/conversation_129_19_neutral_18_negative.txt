"Speaker A: 'So, regarding our meeting today, let’s go over what we've discussed and outline our action items.' 

Speaker B: 'Yes, having clear next steps is crucial for us to move forward effectively.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We’ll draft the agreement by next week, and set the follow-up meeting afterwards.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds reasonable. Now, about implementing these contracts, we might face some challenges.'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, enforcement has been tricky in the past.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We’ve encountered several roadblocks, especially with compliance on certain terms.'

Speaker A: 'We need to find ways to mitigate these issues to ensure smooth enforcement this time.'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps including stricter clauses could help, but we should be cautious about creating additional barriers.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a valid point. Balancing enforceability with flexibility is key.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, let’s aim to resolve these concerns efficiently in our upcoming drafts.'"
