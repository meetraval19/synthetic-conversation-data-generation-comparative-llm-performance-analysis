Speaker B: 'Absolutely, I want to ensure we're looking at all angles without jumping to conclusions.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, a risk assessment helps to provide a clear picture without any biases.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Now, what about planning the case timeline? I’ve heard it can be quite a challenge.'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, you're right. Timelines can be unpredictable and sometimes frustrating, especially with court schedules changing frequently.'

Speaker B: 'I was worried about that. The delays could impact our plans significantly.'
