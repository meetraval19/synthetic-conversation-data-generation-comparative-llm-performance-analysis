Speaker B: 'Sure, I've gathered all the relevant documents. I assume you'll provide a balanced assessment?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Our aim is to understand where you stand without jumping to conclusions.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds fair. What about resolving potential conflicts? I've heard there are several effective ways.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, there are plenty of positive outcomes from mediation and arbitration. They’re often faster and less combative than traditional court battles.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. I’d prefer a solution that’s both efficient and amicable.'

Speaker A: 'Mediation often leads to collaborative agreements, which is a win-win for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'Great, I’m glad to hear there are constructive paths we can take. Thanks for the guidance!'"
