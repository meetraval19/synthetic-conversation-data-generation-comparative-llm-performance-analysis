Speaker B: 'I understand. The potential liabilities are a concern, but we can mitigate some of these risks with careful wording.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, though the risk landscape is changing rapidly, which makes it tricky.'

Speaker B: 'True. Now, moving on to selecting the jurisdiction, do you have any particular preference?'

Speaker A: 'Not particularly, as long as the framework is clear and mutually agreed upon.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We can look at some neutral options that provide a stable legal environment.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds reasonable. Let's ensure the governing law aligns with the broader objectives of the contract.'"
