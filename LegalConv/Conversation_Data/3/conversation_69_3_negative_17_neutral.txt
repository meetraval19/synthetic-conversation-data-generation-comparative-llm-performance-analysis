Speaker B: 'Absolutely. I've noticed a few areas that could potentially expose us to more risk than usual.'

Speaker A: 'It’s crucial we identify all possible liabilities before proceeding further.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and while it might seem daunting, it’s better to be thorough now to avoid surprises later.'

Speaker B: 'Pretty standard, actually. I've gone through the main documents, and everything seems in order. No major red flags.'

Speaker A: 'Good to hear. We definitely want to ensure everything is clear and precise, but it’s nice when nothing too complex arises.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, just the usual due diligence. Let’s continue making sure everything is aligned with our objectives.'"
