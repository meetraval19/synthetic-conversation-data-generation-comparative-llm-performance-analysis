"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how the risk assessment has turned out. We've identified areas we can confidently manage.' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, our efforts in assessing potential issues are paying off. It’s reassuring to know the strengths we can leverage in this negotiation.' 

Speaker A: 'Agreed. However, we still need to address the concerns surrounding which laws are applicable. It's causing some unease on our end.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. The complexity of differing jurisdictions can create unexpected hurdles. We should aim to resolve this early on to avoid any future complications.'

Speaker A: 'That's exactly my thinking. Maybe we can explore a middle ground that respects both parties' legal frameworks without complicating the process further.'

Speaker B: 'That would be ideal. Let’s prioritize resolving the jurisdictional issues, ensuring they don't overshadow our positive progress with the risk management strategy.' 

Speaker A: 'I’m hopeful that finding a solution here will make the next phases much smoother for both sides.' 

Speaker B: 'Agreed, a well-crafted agreement benefits everyone involved. Let’s keep the momentum going.'"
