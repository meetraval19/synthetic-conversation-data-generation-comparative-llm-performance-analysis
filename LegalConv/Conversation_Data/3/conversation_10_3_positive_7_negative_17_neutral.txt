"Speaker A: 'Our legal risk assessment suggests we might have more leverage than we initially thought.'

Speaker B: 'That’s encouraging. It could improve our position in these negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. However, I'm concerned about our current legal strategy. It seems to lack flexibility and might not cover all angles.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve been feeling the same. We should consider revisiting our approach to ensure it's robust enough for any unforeseen developments.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Let's focus on drafting and reviewing all the legal documents thoroughly. We need everything in order before we proceed.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, keeping everything well-documented will help us maintain clarity during the negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. With a solid assessment and detailed documents, we should be well-prepared to handle the discussions ahead.'"
