Speaker B: 'I agree, it's a challenging situation. The potential liabilities are certainly an issue we need to mitigate as soon as possible.'

Speaker A: 'On a more positive note, I believe there are promising settlement options we can explore. Our strategy could really turn things around if approached correctly.'
