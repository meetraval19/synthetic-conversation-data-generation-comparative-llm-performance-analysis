"Speaker A: 'During our litigation meeting, let's start with the evaluation of potential risks.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the risk assessment appears comprehensive, doesn't favor either side heavily.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, nothing unusual emerged there. Moving on, how is the witness list shaping up?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, we're facing several challenges in witness preparation. There have been repeated inconsistencies.'

Speaker A: 'That's concerning. Do we need additional resources to address these issues?'

Speaker B: 'It might help, but the main problem is the lack of solid testimony from key individuals.'

Speaker A: 'We should explore other angles to strengthen our case if witnesses remain unreliable.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, we can't let this hinder our progress. Let's brainstorm alternatives and regroup tomorrow.'"
