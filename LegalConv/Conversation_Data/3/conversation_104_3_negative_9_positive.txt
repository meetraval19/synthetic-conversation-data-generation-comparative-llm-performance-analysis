"Speaker A: 'I'm concerned about the potential risks involved in our new product. Have you had a chance to look into any legal vulnerabilities?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I did an assessment, and there are quite a few areas that pose significant risks. We need to be careful with how we utilize existing patents.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds worrisome. What specific issues did you uncover?'

Speaker B: 'Primarily, it's about ensuring we don't infringe on any existing intellectual property rights. It's essential to address this proactively.'

Speaker A: 'Understood. What about the contracts we drafted last week? Any positive signs there?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, actually. The contractual terms are solid. They clearly articulate the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved, which is reassuring.'

Speaker A: 'That's a relief to hear. I was hoping the careful drafting would pay off.'

Speaker B: 'It certainly has. The terms are favorable, particularly regarding ownership and distribution rights.'

Speaker A: 'Great! So, while we need to mitigate some risks, at least the contracts are in our favor.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. With a bit of diligence on the risk front, we should be in a strong position.'"
