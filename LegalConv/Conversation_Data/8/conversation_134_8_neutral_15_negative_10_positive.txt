“Speaker A: ‘Let’s review our options for resolving this dispute. Have you considered mediation or arbitration?’

Speaker B: ‘Yeah, both are on the table. They each have pros and cons, so we’ll need to weigh them carefully.’

Speaker A: ‘True, we’ll need to decide soon. Now, regarding our argument formulation, I’m concerned about how it’s shaping up. There seem to be some gaps.’

Speaker B: ‘I know what you mean. I’m worried it might not hold up as strongly as we’d like in court. We need to find a way to reinforce it.’

Speaker A: ‘Agreed. We should look at prior cases for any angles we might be missing.’

Speaker B: ‘Definitely. On a brighter note, I had a productive discussion with the opposing counsel. They seem open to dialogue.’

Speaker A: ‘That’s great news. Building a positive channel with them could open up more avenues for negotiation.’

Speaker B: ‘Exactly, maybe this can help us push forward and potentially reach a settlement.’

Speaker A: ‘I think that’s worth pursuing. Let’s keep that line of communication open while we firm up our arguments.’”
