Speaker B: 'It is crucial, and we'll need to meticulously track these costs as we proceed, making sure nothing spirals out of control.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, collaborating effectively on this will help us make more informed decisions.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a balanced approach will be key to managing both dispute choices and associated expenses effectively.'"
