Speaker B: 'Absolutely! Those options can often lead to amicable solutions and avoid lengthy court proceedings. They’re promising.'

Speaker A: 'Now, we need to dive into forming our arguments. I’m struggling with structuring them so they’re impactful.'

Speaker B: 'I've reviewed them all, and they’re looking just fine. Nothing out of the ordinary, but we should double-check for any last tweaks.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. We’ll make sure they’re polished before submission. Thank you for your thoroughness.'

Speaker B: 'No problem. Let’s keep up this momentum as we get closer to the hearing.'"
