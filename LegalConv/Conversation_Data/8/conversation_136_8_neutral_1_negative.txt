"Speaker A: 'Let's start by looking at the different ways we can approach this situation. There are several dispute resolution options available.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, there are, but it's essential to understand what the client's main goals and priorities are. They seem dissatisfied with how things have progressed so far.'

Speaker A: 'True, that dissatisfaction can complicate finding a suitable path forward. However, reviewing options like mediation or arbitration might help us see things from a neutral perspective.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, but the client's concerns about time and costs are significant. They've been feeling overwhelmed by these factors.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, those concerns cannot be overlooked. Maybe we can delve into how different approaches might address their priorities more effectively.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Balancing the neutral nature of available resolution methods with the client's needs might lead us to a more tailored strategy.'"
