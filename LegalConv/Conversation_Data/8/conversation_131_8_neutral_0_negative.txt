"Speaker A: 'When preparing for this case, we should start by looking at the different ways we could approach resolving the dispute.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We could either go for mediation or arbitration, depending on what suits both parties best.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, both have their advantages. Mediation can be less formal, but arbitration might give us a more structured outcome.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, but let’s not forget the main challenge here—the core of the issue itself.'

Speaker A: 'You’re right. Identifying the exact problems can be tricky, especially with so many layers involved.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, and it seems like every time we peel back one layer, we find more complexity. It’s quite frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'It is. We’ll have to dig deeper into each detail to avoid any oversight, which could hinder our progress.'

Speaker B: 'That’s true. The sooner we clarify those issues, the better our position will be when we head into negotiations.'"
