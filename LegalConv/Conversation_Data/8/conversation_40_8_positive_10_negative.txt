Speaker B: 'That sounds promising. I definitely prefer something that avoids a long court process.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It often results in a more collaborative solution, which can help preserve relationships.'

Speaker B: 'Speaking of relationships, communication with the other party has been tense. It’s been hard to get any cooperation.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Miscommunication and lack of willingness can create a negative atmosphere.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it's like they’re unwilling to consider any options. It makes everything so much harder.'
