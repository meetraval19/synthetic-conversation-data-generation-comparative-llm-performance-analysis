"Speaker A: 'We've been looking at our options for resolving this dispute, and it's not looking promising.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The current methods available seem time-consuming and costly.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, mediation might drag on without clear results, and arbitration could become quite expensive.'

Speaker B: 'Let's pivot our focus to something more optimistic. Our recent compliance review turned out better than expected.'

Speaker A: 'That's true, the new regulations seemed daunting at first, but our team handled the review superbly.'

Speaker B: 'It's great to see our preparation and attention to detail paying off—no major issues noted.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It’s a relief to know our compliance protocols are robust.' 

Speaker B: 'Maybe we can leverage our strong compliance standing in the dispute to gain some traction.'

Speaker A: 'That's a good point. We should highlight that in our discussions moving forward.'"
