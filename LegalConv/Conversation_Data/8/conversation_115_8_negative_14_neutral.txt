Speaker A: "We've been exploring various ways to settle this case, and honestly, the options are quite limited."

Speaker B: "I agree. Mediation and arbitration haven't shown much promise in similar cases lately."

Speaker B: "Exactly, and they seem to prolong the process without much benefit."

Speaker A: "On another note, how are we doing with preparing our witnesses?"

Speaker B: "The team's making good progress. The key witnesses are well-coached for the deposition."

Speaker A: "That's reassuring. The preparation work seems stable so far."

Speaker B: "Yes, no major issues. Just ensuring they stay consistent."

Speaker A: "Alright, let's focus on strengthening our positions where possible."

Speaker B: "Absolutely, maintaining clarity and readiness is key moving forward."
