Speaker B: 'Yes, finding the right approach has been challenging. Alternative resolution methods are necessary, but none seem perfect for this situation.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's shift focus to what our client is prioritizing right now.'

Speaker B: 'Understanding their objectives is key. They seem pretty open to solutions as long as the outcome aligns with their long-term vision.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We should clarify that with them as soon as possible.'
