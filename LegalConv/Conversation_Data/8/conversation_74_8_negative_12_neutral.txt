“Speaker A: 'Given our current case, the dispute resolution options seem quite limited and challenging.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The arbitration process is turning out to be more tedious than expected.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Mediation didn't offer much progress either; it’s frustrating to have so few effective paths.'

Speaker B: 'On a different note, I’ve completed the regulatory compliance review for the upcoming trial.'

Speaker A: 'How did that go?'

Speaker B: 'It was pretty standard. No major violations found, which is a relief.'

Speaker A: 'It's reassuring to know we're following all necessary guidelines. Keeps things steady amid all the other issues.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, knowing we're compliant definitely eases some pressure on the legal front.'"
