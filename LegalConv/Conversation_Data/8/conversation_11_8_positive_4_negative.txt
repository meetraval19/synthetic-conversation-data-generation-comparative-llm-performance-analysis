"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the options we have for resolving this dispute, and I think there's a lot to be optimistic about.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Mediation or arbitration could offer a more collaborative approach that might benefit both parties.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It feels like the process can be quite efficient and potentially less adversarial.'

Speaker B: 'However, I'm concerned about maintaining confidentiality throughout the process. It seems like there could be some risks involved.'

Speaker A: 'That's a valid point. Ensuring privilege is secured can be tricky, and any leaks could be detrimental.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. We need to ensure that any agreements are ironclad in terms of confidentiality clauses.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, minimizing that risk will be crucial.'
