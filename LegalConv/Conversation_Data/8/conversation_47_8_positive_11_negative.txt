"Speaker A: 'I'm quite optimistic about our dispute resolution options for this case. Mediation could lead to a quick settlement.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Mediation often brings both parties to common ground. We should definitely propose it.'

Speaker A: 'It's great because it allows for more flexibility in crafting a solution, unlike going to court.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and it tends to preserve professional relationships better too.'

Speaker A: 'Now, on to the cost estimates. It's concerning how quickly these litigations could deplete our budget.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. The expenses for gathering expert witnesses and court fees are notably high.'

Speaker A: 'We need to find ways to keep the costs from spiraling. Maybe tighten up on non-essential expenditures.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, we might need to revise our budget and explore more cost-effective resources.'"
