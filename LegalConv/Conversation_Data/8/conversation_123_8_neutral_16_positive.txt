Speaker B: 'Sure, we could consider arbitration or mediation. Both need careful evaluation.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and both approaches have their pros and cons, making it essential to stay neutral for now.'

Speaker A: 'It really puts us in a strong position, especially in terms of managing client expectations.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, maintaining that positive outlook on jurisdiction helps us in crafting a reliable strategy.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Let's keep that momentum as we proceed.'â€™"
