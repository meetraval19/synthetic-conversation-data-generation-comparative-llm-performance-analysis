"Speaker A: 'Let's discuss the available methods to resolve this conflict. Honestly, neither arbitration nor mediation seems to offer a clear path forward.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your frustration. It can be tough to see a favorable solution when both options have limitations.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, especially when we consider both the costs and the time involved in these processes.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. However, understanding what our clients actually want is crucial. Are their priorities aligned with a quick resolution, or are there deeper considerations?'

Speaker A: 'That's a good point. Their goals seem balanced between getting closure and ensuring a fair outcome.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and while the current mechanisms might seem unappealing, they do provide a framework we can work with given the client's objectives.'

Speaker A: 'I suppose we need to weigh each aspect carefully and maybe reassess the client's expectations.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, moving forward, aligning those expectations with realistic outcomes will be important for all parties involved.'"
