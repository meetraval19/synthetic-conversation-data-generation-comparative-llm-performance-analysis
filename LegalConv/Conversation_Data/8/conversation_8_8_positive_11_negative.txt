"Speaker A: 'I'm glad we have a range of options for resolving your dispute. Mediation could be a less adversarial choice.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds promising. I’ve heard it’s more collaborative than going to court.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it often fosters more amicable solutions and is generally quicker.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. I’m keen to find something that keeps relationships intact.'

Speaker A: 'One thing to keep in mind, though, is the cost implications of each option.'

Speaker B: 'I was worried about that. Legal processes always seem to be more expensive than planned.'

Speaker A: 'It can be challenging to forecast expenses precisely, and costs can escalate unexpectedly.'

Speaker B: 'I see. It’s just tough to manage a budget not knowing how much the final expense will be.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's crucial to plan carefully and discuss all potential scenarios beforehand.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate your honesty. Finding a cost-effective path forward will be important for me.'"
