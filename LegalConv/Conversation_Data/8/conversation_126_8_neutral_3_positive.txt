Speaker A: 'Exactly, both have their merits. It's about finding what aligns best with our goals.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, the risk assessment looks promising. We’ve minimized potential liabilities significantly.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, being thorough with this assessment has really set us on a positive path moving forward.'"
