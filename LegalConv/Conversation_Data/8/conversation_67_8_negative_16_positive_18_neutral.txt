"Speaker A: 'When discussing our agreement, the governing law part looks promising. It's great that we've agreed on a jurisdiction that both parties feel confident about.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a clear and favorable jurisdiction is beneficial for both sides. However, I'm concerned about the dispute resolution options. Arbitration hasn't always been the smoothest approach in past experiences.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concerns. Arbitration can be unpredictable at times. Perhaps we should explore alternatives or additional safeguards to address potential issues.'

Speaker B: 'That would be wise. On another note, I’m a bit unclear on how we handle any unforeseen enforcement and implementation issues that might arise. Should we outline some contingency plans?'

Speaker A: 'It makes sense to be prepared. We can definitely draft some guidelines that would provide flexibility depending on the situation. It’s important to ensure both parties feel secure moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let’s focus on refining these areas to ensure a well-rounded agreement.'"
