Speaker B: 'I understand. It’s important to manage those expectations to align with what’s feasible in court.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Meanwhile, we should also do a thorough review of the compliance documents.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, going through the regulations one more time will ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. As for the witnesses, have they all been prepped thoroughly?'

Speaker B: 'They’ve gone through their sessions. Everything seems in order, but we should remain available for any last-minute questions.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. The more prepared they are, the smoother the proceedings will go.'"
