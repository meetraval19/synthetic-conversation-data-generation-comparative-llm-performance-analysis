"Speaker A: 'Our client's main goals revolve around achieving a favorable settlement swiftly. They've expressed a strong desire for a positive outcome to move forward.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. Understanding their priorities will help us shape the negotiation to their advantage.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, regarding possible ways to resolve this dispute, mediation might be a neutral ground. It offers flexibility without the formality of court.'
