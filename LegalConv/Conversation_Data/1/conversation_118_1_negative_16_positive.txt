Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been a challenge. It seems like there are conflicting interests that we’re not fully aware of.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it’s creating some unnecessary tension. We need a clearer picture to move effectively.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Maybe a direct meeting with the whole team could clarify their objectives.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a good idea. Now, on a brighter note, I reviewed the new governing law and our jurisdictional stance.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, great! How does it look?'

Speaker A: 'The governing law is definitely in our favor. It aligns well with our strategic approach.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. At least now we can better navigate the legal framework.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. It gives us stronger footing. Let's make sure we leverage this advantage fully.'"
