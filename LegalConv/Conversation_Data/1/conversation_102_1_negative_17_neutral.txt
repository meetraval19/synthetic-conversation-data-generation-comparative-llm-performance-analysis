"Speaker A: 'I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on. I'm not sure we’re on track to meet my priorities.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It’s important to set realistic timelines. Let’s go over your goals again and adjust if needed. We’ll focus on what’s achievable.'

Speaker A: 'I appreciate that. I’m just concerned we might be focusing too much on the smaller details.'

Speaker B: 'We’ll make sure to prioritize effectively. Regarding the documents, have you had a chance to review the latest drafts?'

Speaker A: 'I glanced through them. They appear to be detailed, but I’m not completely sure if they cover everything needed.'

Speaker B: 'That’s understandable. Legal documents can be quite intricate. We can walk through them together to ensure clarity.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that sounds helpful. I just want to make sure we’re not missing anything critical.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We’ll double-check each section to guarantee everything aligns with your objectives.'"
