"Speaker A: 'I understand you're feeling a bit uncertain about your goals with this case.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it’s been overwhelming trying to prioritize everything. The complexity just adds to the stress.'

Speaker A: 'Let's try to simplify your priorities and address the most urgent aspects first. On a brighter note, I believe we can set a realistic timeline to keep everything on track.'

Speaker B: 'That would be really helpful. Having clear key dates would at least give me something to aim for.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We can outline all crucial milestones, and I think you'll find some reassurance in having that structure.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. And what about the documents and evidence we need to go through?'

Speaker A: 'We'll review everything carefully. It’s a straightforward process but requires attention to detail. No major surprises are expected there.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, that sounds manageable. I just hope we can get through this smoothly.'

Speaker A: 'We'll tackle it step by step. Focusing on the timeline should alleviate some pressure, allowing us to address your other concerns effectively.'"
