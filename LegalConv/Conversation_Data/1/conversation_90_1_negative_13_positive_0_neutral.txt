Speaker A: 'Switching gears, I think we’ve done a good job identifying the core legal issues. Everything seems clear-cut in that regard.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, pinpointing the exact issues early on helped clarify our approach.'

Speaker A: 'It’s neutral ground, but knowing those specificities sets the stage for better decision-making.'
