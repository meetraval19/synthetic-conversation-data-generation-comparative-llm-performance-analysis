"Speaker A: 'It's great to hear that both parties are open to discussing the core interests and priorities each side has.' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, understanding what each client truly values can lead us towards a mutually beneficial resolution.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding the resolution methods, some of the traditional approaches might not serve us well in this scenario.'
