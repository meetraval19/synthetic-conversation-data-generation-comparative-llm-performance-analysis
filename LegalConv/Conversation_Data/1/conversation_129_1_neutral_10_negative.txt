"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing your objectives and what you hope to achieve from this case.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, my main goal is to resolve this matter efficiently. I’m open to hearing your suggestions on the best approach.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a wise perspective. We’ll focus on efficiently addressing the key areas without unnecessary complications.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. However, I'm concerned about dealing with the other party. Communication has been quite challenging.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It can be difficult, especially if they’re not cooperative. We’ll strategize on how to handle these interactions carefully.'

Speaker B: 'It feels like every conversation ends in frustration or goes nowhere.'

Speaker A: 'That’s unfortunate, but not uncommon. We’ll work on a plan to improve the negotiations and aim for more productive discussions.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I hope we can steer this in a better direction.'"
