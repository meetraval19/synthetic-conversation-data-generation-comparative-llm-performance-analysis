Speaker B: 'Exactly. It's frustrating when there's a lack of clarity in their objectives, which complicates our compliance efforts.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, especially when we continuously emphasize the importance of aligning with current regulations.'

Speaker B: 'True, having a clear approach to navigate through implementation is beneficial.'
