"Speaker A: 'Our compliance review meeting today might not be as smooth as we hoped, especially considering the client isn't thrilled with the current goals.’  
Speaker B: 'I understand. Their priorities seem to be shifting, which complicates the alignment with regulatory requirements.'  
Speaker A: 'Right, and they've been quite vocal about the disconnect between what we’re drafting and their expectations.'  
Speaker B: 'It’s clear we need to address these concerns head-on, perhaps revisit some parts of our approach.'  
Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a different note, how are we shaping up with our legal argument formulation?'  
Speaker B: 'It’s progressing steadily. We’re making sure all bases are covered, but it remains a straightforward task.'  
Speaker A: 'Good to hear. As long as we stay thorough, we should manage to craft a solid argument to meet compliance.'  
Speaker B: 'Yes, keeping it clear and comprehensive will be key, especially if we have to adjust to meet any last-minute regulatory changes.'"
