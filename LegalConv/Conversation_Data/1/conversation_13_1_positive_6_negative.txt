"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing the client's objectives. It's great to see such clear goals and prioritiesâ€”they really set a positive direction for this negotiation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Having a clear vision makes everything smoother. It helps us focus on what's genuinely important for the client.'

Speaker A: 'Now, moving on to the discovery phase, the document review has been particularly challenging. There are a few issues that could complicate matters.'
