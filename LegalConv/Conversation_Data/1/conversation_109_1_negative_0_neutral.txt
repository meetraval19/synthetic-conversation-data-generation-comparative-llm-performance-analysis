Speaker B: 'Yes, I noticed that too. It's crucial we address these priorities effectively, or we risk further dissatisfaction.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, during the compliance check, we've identified some potential legal issues that need more exploration.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, it's important that we thoroughly understand these issues before they escalate into major problems, even if they seem minor now.'
