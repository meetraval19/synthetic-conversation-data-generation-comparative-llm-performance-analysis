"Speaker A: 'It seems there's been a lot of tension regarding the expectations we have from this settlement.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, our client's goals seem misaligned with what's realistically achievable right now.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It's always challenging when expectations don't match the situation. How about our communication channels with the opposing parties? Have they been effective?'

Speaker B: 'They've been adequate, I suppose. Weâ€™ve managed to keep things professional and neutral, though there's always room for improvement.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. Maintaining a neutral tone is crucial in mediating these differences. Shall we reassess the client's priorities to see if we can bridge some gaps?'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a plan. It might help in resetting expectations to something more feasible.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's aim to refocus on mutual interests that can lead to a satisfactory resolution for both sides.'"
