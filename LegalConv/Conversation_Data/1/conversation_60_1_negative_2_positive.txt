Speaker B: 'Yes, I'm worried that my priorities might be all mixed up with everything that's going on.'

Speaker A: 'It can be challenging, but let's focus on adjusting your goals to make things more manageable.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. But I’m also concerned about how complicated these goals seem right now.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Having those laws in our corner helps us navigate through this with more clarity.'

Speaker B: 'I guess that does ease some of the pressure. Knowing there’s a structured path is comforting.'
