"Speaker A: 'I’ve reviewed the clauses in the draft agreement, and some seem quite restrictive.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. Which clauses are troubling you?'

Speaker A: 'Primarily, the ones about penalties. They could be quite burdensome.'

Speaker B: 'Those terms are standard, but I can see your point. We might be able to negotiate some flexibility there.'

Speaker A: 'That would definitely help. Now, regarding the information shared during discussions, how are we handling privacy?'

Speaker B: 'We intend to keep everything confidential. It’s vital all parties feel secure.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. But remember, maintaining privilege is crucial as we proceed.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We’ll ensure all protocols are followed. Let’s focus on resolving the contract elements first.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, adjusting those terms is our priority. The rest can be addressed once we’re aligned on that front.'"
