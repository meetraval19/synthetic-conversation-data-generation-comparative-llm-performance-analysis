"Speaker A: 'I've reviewed your contractual terms, and there are a few areas that seem problematic.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, that doesn't sound good. What issues are you seeing?'

Speaker A: 'Some clauses are unclear and might lead to disputes if not addressed properly.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate you pointing that out. What about identifying any potential legal issues?'

Speaker A: 'On that front, everything seems fairly standard. No major concerns, just the usual diligence required.'

Speaker B: 'Thatâ€™s a relief. How about our confidentiality agreements?'

Speaker A: 'Those are actually quite robust. Your provisions for maintaining privilege look very strong.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. We wanted to ensure our sensitive information is well-protected.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, protecting confidentiality is crucial, and you've done an excellent job there.'"
