"Speaker A: 'I just finished going through the latest contract draft. The terms are quite problematic this time.'

Speaker B: 'Really? What's the main issue you're seeing?'

Speaker A: 'The conditions seem heavily tilted in their favor. I think we might have some major negotiation ahead.'

Speaker B: 'That’s concerning. We need to prepare a strong counter.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. On a different note, have you had any recent discussions with the opposing counsel?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, we exchanged a few emails. It was pretty standard; nothing significant came up.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, good to know there’s been no unexpected surprises there.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, it's been straightforward so far.'

Speaker A: 'How are we looking on our timeline and key milestones for the case preparation?'

Speaker B: 'We're on schedule. The key dates are all aligned with our initial plan.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. Let's keep everything on track.' 

Speaker B: 'Definitely, and let's revisit those terms in more detail tomorrow.' 

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a plan. We need to sort those issues promptly.'"
