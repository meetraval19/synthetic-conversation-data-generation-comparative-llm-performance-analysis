"Speaker A: 'I just reviewed the contract, and some of the terms are quite troubling. They seem overly restrictive.'

Speaker B: 'That's concerning. We might need to negotiate those terms to ensure they're fair and balanced.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On another note, I noticed the document mentioned both New York and California for legal matters. That could complicate things.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, having multiple jurisdictions involved can lead to ambiguity. It's important to be clear about which state's law will govern.'

Speaker A: 'True, we should make sure that's clarified. As for potential issues, have you spotted anything else that might cause problems down the line?'

Speaker B: 'I noticed a few areas, like lack of clarity on responsibilities. It doesn't seem urgent but worth addressing to prevent future misunderstandings.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Let's ensure we cover every aspect, so there are no surprises later.'"
