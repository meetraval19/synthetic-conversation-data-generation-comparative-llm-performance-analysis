Speaker B: 'Yes, those terms could indeed complicate matters. We need to address them before the hearing.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, but moving on to the timeline, I think we're on track for the scheduled dates.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. The timeline seems manageable, and we should be able to meet our deadlines.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, let’s focus on what needs to be done next. We should prioritize drafting our arguments.'

Speaker A: 'Perfect. Once we resolve the contract issues, we'll have a stronger stance.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, let’s ensure everything is thorough and the preparations go smoothly.'"
