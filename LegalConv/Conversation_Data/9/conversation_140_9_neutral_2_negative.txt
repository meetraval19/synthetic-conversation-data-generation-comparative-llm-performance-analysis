Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having clarity in those terms is crucial. I feel pretty neutral about them since they haven't caused issues yet.'

Speaker A: 'That's a logical approach. Now, about ensuring we're compliant with all the necessary laws and regulationsâ€”have there been any challenges?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, there have been some hurdles. Keeping up with constant changes in regulations can be quite a headache.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, especially with intellectual property laws evolving rapidly. It can feel overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It often feels like we're playing catch-up to avoid potential pitfalls.'

Speaker A: 'Let's work through these issues together and find a way to navigate those legal changes more smoothly.'"
