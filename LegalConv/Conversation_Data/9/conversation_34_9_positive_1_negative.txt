"Speaker A: 'Let's start with the contractual terms. I reviewed them last night and they look really promising for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The clarity and fairness in these terms are a great foundation for our partnership.'

Speaker A: 'However, I noticed that aligning with the client's priorities is proving to be a bit challenging.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that's been a sticking point. Their shifting goals are making it tough to finalize details.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we can propose a phased approach to address their priorities gradually.'

Speaker B: 'That might work, but weâ€™ll need to ensure their expectations are well-managed.' 

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, having those transparent conversations early on will be crucial for smoother negotiations ahead.'"
