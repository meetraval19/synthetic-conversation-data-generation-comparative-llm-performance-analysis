"Speaker A: 'I went through the latest draft, and I have some concerns about the clauses related to the termination terms.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Some of the language is a bit restrictive, isn't it?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, exactly. It could create complications down the line if one side wants to exit the agreement.'

Speaker B: 'We should definitely address that. On a brighter note, I've found our discussions with the other team to be quite productive.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, they've been very responsive and open to suggestions. It's refreshing.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. They've acknowledged quite a few points we raised without any pushback too.'

Speaker A: 'That's true. Let's focus on these positive channels to negotiate better terms.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I'll draft some revisions that reflect our concerns. Their cooperation should help us streamline the process.'

Speaker A: 'Great. Let's keep communication open and these updates flowing. Itâ€™ll make the whole negotiation smoother.'"
