"Speaker A: 'Let's start by reviewing the terms of the contract.' 

Speaker B: 'Sure, but I have to say some of these clauses seem quite rigid and unfavorable.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concerns. We can definitely work on making them more flexible.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. Now, moving on to confidentiality, I believe maintaining privilege is straightforward in this case.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Both parties seem aligned on those points without any major issues.'

Speaker B: 'And what about communication channels with the opposing parties? Are we set?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the lines of communication should remain open, yet professional. Everything looks smooth there.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect, letâ€™s focus on adjusting those challenging terms then.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, let's prioritize that to ensure mutual satisfaction.'"
