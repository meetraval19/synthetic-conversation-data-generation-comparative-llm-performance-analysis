Speaker B: 'I'm glad to hear that. A fair and clear agreement is always beneficial.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It seems like we're aligned on those points. Now, moving on, the discussion around the governing law hasn't been as smooth.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I understand. Determining the jurisdiction has been quite challenging, given the complexities involved.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, but it's crucial to settle on this to avoid potential disputes in the future.'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, the differing state laws make this a bit of a sticky situation.'

Speaker A: 'True, but perhaps we can find a middle ground. Maybe an alternative dispute resolution could be beneficial.'

Speaker B: 'That might be a viable solution. Let's explore that further and see if we can bring this to a positive close.'"
