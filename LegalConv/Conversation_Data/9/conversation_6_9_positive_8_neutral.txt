"Speaker A: 'I've been going through the agreements, and the review of the contract terms looks promising. We've covered most bases effectively.'

Speaker B: 'That's great news. Clarity in those terms can definitely work in our favor.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. The thoroughness gives us a solid foundation for any argument.'

Speaker B: 'When it comes to resolving disputes, I'm considering a few pathways. Mediation seems worth evaluating.'
