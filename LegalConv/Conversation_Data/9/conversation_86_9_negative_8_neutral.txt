"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about the new terms in this draft. They seem more restrictive than what we initially discussed.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. We did tighten some clauses, but it’s important to clarify each party’s obligations.'

Speaker A: 'True, but we need to ensure the terms are fair and workable for both sides. We should revisit some of these restrictions.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, let’s go over them and see how we can make adjustments that work for everyone.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, have you thought about the options we want for resolving potential disputes?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I believe we have a few alternatives. Mediation could be a good first step, offering flexibility.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. It’s often less adversarial than arbitration or litigation. It provides a neutral ground.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it might help us settle things more amicably if issues arise. Let’s formalize this section in the contract.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a plan. With constructive discussion, I’m sure we can fine-tune these details.'"
