Speaker B: 'That's a relief to hear. My main worry was about any hidden clauses or pitfalls.'

Speaker A: 'Not to worry, the terms are straightforward and seem to protect your interests well. However, we need to address the potential compliance issues.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've been concerned about meeting all the regulations, especially with how quickly they change.'
