"Speaker A: 'I’ve been reviewing the terms of this contract, and there are quite a few concerning clauses.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. Could you specify what's bothering you?'

Speaker A: 'The liability section seems particularly harsh. It looks like the responsibility is heavily skewed against us.'

Speaker B: 'That does sound worrisome. We might need to negotiate those clauses for better balance.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. I was also looking at the section about which laws will apply.'

Speaker B: 'Ah, the choice of governing law and jurisdiction. That’s something we need to align with our business interests.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it doesn’t seem unfavorable, but I’d like to ensure it won’t complicate future issues.'

Speaker B: 'It’s a neutral factor often, but let’s confirm it supports our operations smoothly.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. I’ll gather more details so we can strategize our approach more effectively.'"
