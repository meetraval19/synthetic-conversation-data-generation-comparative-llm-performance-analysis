"Speaker A: 'I recently went through the latest contract drafts, and there are quite a few issues with the terms they proposed.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It seems like there's always a challenge when it comes to aligning contractual language with our requirements.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Some sections are so ambiguous that they're bound to cause disputes down the road.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, our current policies on confidentiality and privilege have been robustly reinforced this year.'

Speaker A: 'That's true. It's reassuring to know we're safeguarding sensitive information more effectively now.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, maintaining confidentiality is crucial for building trust with our clients.'

Speaker A: 'If only the contract negotiations could be as smooth as our progress on confidentiality measures.'

Speaker B: 'Well, one step at a time. At least we have a strong foundation to build on.'"
