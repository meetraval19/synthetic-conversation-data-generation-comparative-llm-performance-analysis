"Speaker A: 'I've reviewed the contractual terms, and they're well-structured to protect your intellectual property rights.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. I was concerned about how comprehensive it might be. It's reassuring to know we've covered all bases.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it looks solid. Now, regarding the cost estimates and budget planning, there are some challenges.'

Speaker B: 'I was afraid of that. The budget is tighter than we hoped, isn't it?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it does pose some constraints. We might need to reassess and prioritize certain elements.'

Speaker B: 'I guess we'll have to be strategic about it. Perhaps explore alternative funding in the future?'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. We should explore every avenue to ensure you're getting the most value without compromising protection.'"
