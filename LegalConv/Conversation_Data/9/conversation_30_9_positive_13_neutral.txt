"Speaker A: 'I recently went through the draft, and the language of the contracts seems quite robust this time.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief! It really makes things smoother when the terms are clear and favorable.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It should give us more leverage in negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, have you thought about the different approaches we could take for potential settlements?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I've considered a few strategies. It doesn't seem like either side is particularly advantaged right now.'

Speaker B: 'True, it feels like we're in a waiting game. It might be best to stay flexible and see how things develop.' 

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We'll just have to keep all options on the table for now.'"
