Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. I mainly want to ensure everything is fair and clear.'

Speaker B: 'Great. I'm more concerned about potential issues with where disputes would be resolved.'

Speaker A: 'Ah, the jurisdiction clause. Itâ€™s a bit problematic, especially if it's in a region with unfavorable laws for your interests.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. I just want peace of mind knowing we're protected.'"
