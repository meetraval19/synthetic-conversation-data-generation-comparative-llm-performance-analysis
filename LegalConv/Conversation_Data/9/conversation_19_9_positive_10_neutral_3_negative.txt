Speaker B: 'I agree. The adjustments made to the compensation and delivery timelines bring clarity and are quite advantageous.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, how have your interactions been with the other side?'

Speaker B: 'Well, we've maintained a pragmatic approach. They've been responsive, though it's been mostly procedural.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. However, I'm a bit concerned about the potential risks we've identified in the compliance sections.'

Speaker B: 'I think so too. A more cautious stance could prevent issues down the line.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and ensuring we've mitigated those risks is key to a successful settlement.'
