"Speaker A: 'We need to discuss the terms in the agreement. Some clauses are quite restrictive.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. The conditions can seem stringent, but there's room for negotiation.'

Speaker A: 'It's crucial these terms don't limit our operational flexibility too much.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's go through them point by point and see where adjustments can be made.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding the schedule, do we have a confirmed timeline?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the key dates are laid out in the current draft.'

Speaker A: 'That seems reasonable. How about we ensure these timelines are realistic?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a realistic timeline is essential for both parties.'

Speaker A: 'Great, let's finalize the schedule then, and continue refining those terms.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. I'll draft changes for our next meeting.'"
