"Speaker A: 'Our review of the contractual obligations is looking promising. The terms are clearly in our favor.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. It gives us a solid foundation for our arguments.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, the clarity helps us outline a strong case. Now, about selecting and prepping witnesses...'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that's been challenging. Some critical witnesses seem unreliable when they're rehearsing their statements.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It’s crucial to ensure consistency and confidence in their testimonies, but it’s proving to be an uphill battle.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, managing their schedules and readiness is another issue. It complicates the overall strategy.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll need to streamline our approach and maybe reassess who we bring to testify, while ensuring the contractual strengths are highlighted effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let’s prioritize getting the right support for witness prep, despite the hurdles.'"
