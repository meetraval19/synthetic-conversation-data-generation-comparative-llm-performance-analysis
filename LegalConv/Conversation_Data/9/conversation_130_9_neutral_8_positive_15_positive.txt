Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It's crucial to understand every clause. It seems straightforward, but we should keep an eye out for any ambiguities.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, moving on to the dispute resolution options, I think we have some strong strategies to consider.'

Speaker B: 'I feel optimistic about exploring mediation. It has the potential to be cost-effective and less adversarial.'
