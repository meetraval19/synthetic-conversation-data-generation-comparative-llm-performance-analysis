"Speaker A: 'I’ve just finished going over the details of the agreement, and there are quite a few areas that don't seem favorable.'

Speaker B: 'Really? What specifically stands out as a concern?'

Speaker A: 'The payment terms are particularly restrictive. It seems like they might cause issues down the line.'

Speaker B: 'That's not ideal. We should definitely address those terms for your benefit.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Additionally, what do you think about how we'd handle disagreements with them?'

Speaker B: 'The options for resolving disputes are pretty straightforward, at least. Mediation and arbitration are on the table.'

Speaker A: 'It’s good to have options, though I’m not sure which would work best for us.'

Speaker B: 'True, but having choices means we can tailor our approach as needed.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a brighter note, I’d like to focus on aligning this deal with your overall objectives.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, ensuring it aligns with our long-term vision is crucial. I'm optimistic about achieving the desired outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'With some adjustments, we can definitely get closer to realizing your priorities.'

Speaker B: 'Great. Much appreciated! Let's make those necessary changes and move forward positively.'"
