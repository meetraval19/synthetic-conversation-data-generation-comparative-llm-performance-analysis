"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the agreements we discussed, and some clauses seem quite concerning.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concern. Which aspects are troubling you specifically?'

Speaker A: 'The indemnity clause appears quite unfavorable. It could expose us to significant risks.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, we'll need to negotiate that. Being cautious with those terms is important.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a different note, have you had a chance to look over the cost predictions?'

Speaker B: 'I have. They seem reasonable at first glance, but we should go into more detail just to be sure.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds wise. It's always good to ensure alignment with our budget expectations.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It's essential to balance the costs with the value and protection we're getting from these agreements.'"
