"Speaker A: 'I understand we've hit some roadblocks with the details in the contract.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the terms aren't quite where we need them to be. It's proving to be more challenging than we expected.'

Speaker A: 'I see your point. However, when we shift our focus to drafting and reviewing the legal documents, there's a lot of progress we can appreciate.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the team did an excellent job with drafting. Their attention to detail really shines through in these documents.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It's a solid foundation. Now, regarding the potential resolutions, we have a few settlement options on the table.'

Speaker B: 'True, though none of them seem particularly favorable right now. It's a bit of a neutral point for us.'

Speaker A: 'I think with some adjustments, we could align these options more closely with our interests.'

Speaker B: 'Let's keep that in mind. We can reconvene once we've had a chance to do a deeper analysis.'"
