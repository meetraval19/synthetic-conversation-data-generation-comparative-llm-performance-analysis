Speaker B: 'I understand where you're coming from. The recent feedback wasn't entirely favorable, either. We should definitely address these constraints in our next meeting.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. On the brighter side, weâ€™ve been making excellent progress with our strategy for the upcoming negotiations. The team has really come together to propose some innovative solutions.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Our approach should provide a strong foundation for the discussions. It's encouraging to see such a dynamic plan taking shape, and it will be beneficial during the settlement talks.'

Speaker A: 'Let's ensure we're thoroughly prepared for the review though. Addressing those unfavorable clauses is crucial before finalization.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Meanwhile, keeping our focus on refining the strategy will give us a clear edge. The synergy has been truly promising.'"
