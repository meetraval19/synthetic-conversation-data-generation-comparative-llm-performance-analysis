"Speaker A: 'I'm pleased with how the review of the contract's details has gone so far; the terms seem to be quite fair and beneficial for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The clarity in the conditions laid out is refreshing. It definitely makes the process smoother.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, we need to discuss the aspect of law and jurisdiction. It's quite standard, but we should confirm we're on the same page.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's crucial we address that. The current proposal seems reasonable, but I think a neutral ground would be preferable to ensure fairness.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's important for both sides to feel comfortable with the adjudication process.'

Speaker B: 'Precisely. Overall, harmonizing these aspects will really strengthen the agreement.'"
