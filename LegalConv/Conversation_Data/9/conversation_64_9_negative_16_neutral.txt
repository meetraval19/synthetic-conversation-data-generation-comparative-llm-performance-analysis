"Speaker A: 'I’ve been going through our client's contract, and there are some troubling clauses that need immediate attention.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. The language around obligations seems overly complex.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and that's causing significant concerns. We need to clarify these terms before presenting them.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's ensure all parties understand what's required to avoid potential disputes.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, how do you feel about the structure surrounding jurisdiction?'

Speaker B: 'It’s quite standard, actually. Doesn’t seem to favor either party unfairly.'

Speaker A: 'That's true. It provides a balanced framework without tipping the scales one way or the other.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and it aligns well with the usual practices in similar agreements.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, let’s focus on redrafting those complex areas and prepare for any questions that might arise.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. I’ll draft some clarifications and we can review them together tomorrow.'"
