Speaker B: 'Sure, it's straightforward, but we should make sure that every clause is crystal clear before we proceed.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It's all about understanding how these terms are applied.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Now, moving on to confidentiality and privilege—it’s tricky.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, handling those aspects is always a challenge. We need to ensure we're not inadvertently breaching any obligations.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the risk of accidentally disclosing privileged information is a real concern. We need to be extra cautious.'

Speaker A: 'I’ll double-check our confidentiality agreements and privilege logs just to be safe.'

Speaker B: 'Good idea. Any oversight could complicate things significantly.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s make sure everyone on the team is aware of these sensitive areas too.'

Speaker B: 'That’s crucial. A single slip can have serious repercussions.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, let's make sure we button everything down before tomorrow.'"
