"Speaker A: 'So, let's start by discussing your potential options for resolving this case.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I'm open to exploring different avenues. What do you suggest?'

Speaker A: 'Well, we could look into mediation or arbitration, as they're often less contentious.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. It's good to have a clear view of the strategies available.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding the financial aspect, I have to be frank. The costs can be considerable.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I was concerned about that. I've heard legal expenses can spiral quickly.'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, that's true. Budget planning will be critical, and it's important to prepare for any unexpected expenses.'

Speaker B: 'I'll need to consider this carefully. It's a bit daunting thinking about the financial side.'

Speaker A: 'I completely understand. Let's work through it together and find the most feasible approach.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. It's reassuring to know there are steps we can take to manage it all.'"
