"Speaker A: 'We’ve reviewed the initial terms, but the proposed methods for settling disputes seem rather limiting.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. The options do seem restrictive, and they could lead to complications later on.'

Speaker A: 'Precisely. It's crucial that we find a more flexible approach to prevent potential issues.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Perhaps we should explore alternative strategies that aren't as limiting?'

Speaker A: 'That sounds wise. On a brighter note, the documents you drafted were exceptionally clear.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you! We focused on making sure every provision was concise and straightforward.'

Speaker A: 'It shows. The language is precise, and it greatly simplifies the negotiation process.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad to hear that. A well-drafted document is essential for aligning both parties and avoiding misunderstandings.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It makes the entire negotiation more positive. Let’s continue refining these documents while we address the settlement strategy.'

Speaker B: 'I’m on board. Let’s make sure everything is airtight and accommodating for both sides.'"
