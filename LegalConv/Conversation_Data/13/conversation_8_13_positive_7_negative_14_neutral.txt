Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a favorable settlement would save our client a lot of stress and time. It's a positive direction for sure.'

Speaker A: 'However, I'm concerned about our current strategy development. It seems like there are too many uncertainties, and we might need to reassess our approach.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The current plan doesn't address a few critical aspects. We need to tighten our arguments and cover more ground.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, how are we doing with selecting and preparing our witnesses?'

Speaker B: 'Certainly, we'll keep the focus on making them feel at ease. Meanwhile, let's circle back to refining our strategy.'"
