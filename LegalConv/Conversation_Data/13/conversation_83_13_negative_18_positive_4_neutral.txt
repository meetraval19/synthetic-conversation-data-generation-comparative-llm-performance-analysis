Speaker B: 'I agree. Every offer has come with significant downsides that we can't overlook.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. They don't seem to reflect the value we're negotiating for, and it feels like we're being pushed into a corner.'

Speaker B: 'That's a fair assessment. Perhaps we need to explore alternatives that better serve our client's interests.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, shifting gears, I am quite optimistic about the recent improvements in how enforcement could play out.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the changes in the regulations have really strengthened our position, making it easier to implement the terms.'

Speaker A: 'It's a relief to see some concrete progress on that front. It sets a better stage for ensuring compliance.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. Now, about maintaining confidentiality and privilege, I think our current protocols are holding up well.'

Speaker A: 'I do agree. There's not much concern there, although staying vigilant continues to be key.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, consistent monitoring will ensure we don't face unexpected issues down the road.'

Speaker A: 'Keeping everything secure is vital, especially as the case develops.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, let's make sure our strategies are airtight moving forward.'"
