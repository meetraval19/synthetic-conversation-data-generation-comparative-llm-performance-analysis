"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the different resolutions we've settled on, and our current strategy looks promising.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, our approach to settlement seems to benefit both parties effectively.'

Speaker A: 'However, when it comes to discussing alternative dispute methods, I'm finding the options quite frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The complexities involved make it less appealing and more cumbersome.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's focus on enhancing our strategies where we can and address the budget concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, focusing on potential improvements is our best course for now.'"
