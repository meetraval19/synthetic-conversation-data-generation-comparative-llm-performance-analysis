"Speaker A: 'I think we've outlined some promising options for settling this case. The strategy we’ve come up with could work well for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The flexibility in our approach allows us to accommodate the main interests each party has.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about putting everything into action, we need to consider the practical implications to ensure smooth enforcement.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We should anticipate potential hurdles and have a plan in place to address them, even if they seem minor now.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. As for the confidentiality aspect, I’m a bit concerned. Keeping everything privileged is becoming increasingly complex.'

Speaker B: 'I know what you mean. It's a challenge to maintain confidentiality with all the information flowing between parties.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll need to draft very precise clauses to safeguard sensitive information, which can help mitigate some of those risks.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. We can consult with the team to tighten up those areas.'"
