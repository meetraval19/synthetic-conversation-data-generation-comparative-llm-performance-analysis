Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. It seems like the strategy on the other side really narrows what we can aim for.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We have to be creative, but it's challenging when we're working within such constraints.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. On another note, we should discuss how we'll prepare the witnesses.'

Speaker A: 'Right. I think we should select them based on who can offer the most neutral and compelling testimony.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Their preparation will be crucial, but we're on track to ensure they're ready for anything.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, focusing on getting them comfortable and confident is key.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's make sure they understand the context without overwhelming them with too many details.'"
