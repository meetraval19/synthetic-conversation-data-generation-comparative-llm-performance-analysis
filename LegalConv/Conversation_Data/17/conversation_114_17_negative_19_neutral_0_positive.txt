"Speaker A: 'I’ve been reviewing the draft documents, and I must say, we've got some issues. The clauses don't quite align with our strategy, and it feels cumbersome.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. We need to tighten the language to avoid any misinterpretations. Let’s prioritize revising these sections before filing.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a more positive note, I think we've really nailed the key areas in identifying the core legal issues. It’s a solid foundation for our argument.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Spotting those crucial points early on has set us up nicely for the next phase.'

Speaker A: 'So, what do you think should be our immediate steps once revisions are completed?'

Speaker B: 'Well, after refining the documents, it’s pretty straightforward. We should focus on organizing our evidence and prepping for depositions.'

Speaker A: 'Seems like a reasonable approach. Let’s see how quickly we can move on those action items without rushing the quality of our work.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We’ll need to manage our resources wisely to stay on track with the timeline.'

Speaker A: 'Sure thing. I’ll coordinate with the team to ensure everyone is clear on their responsibilities moving forward.' 

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a plan. Let’s reconvene after making these revisions to ensure we're all aligned.'"
