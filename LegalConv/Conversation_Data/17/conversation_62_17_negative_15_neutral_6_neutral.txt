"Speaker A: 'I've noticed some issues with how the contracts were originally drafted. It feels like there were significant oversights.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concern. Sometimes drafting can miss critical nuances, leading to complications down the line.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and those oversights caused unnecessary friction between our parties.'

Speaker B: 'Appreciating that, let's focus on formulating our arguments. We need to present both perspectives clearly to find common ground.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. A well-structured argument will make a big difference.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on to the review of evidence, how do you feel about the submitted documents?'

Speaker B: 'They seem quite comprehensive. We should ensure nothing was missed in the initial submission.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, going through them thoroughly will help us address any potential gaps.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a detailed review will clarify our position and aid in better negotiations.'"
