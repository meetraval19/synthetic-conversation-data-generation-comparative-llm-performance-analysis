"Speaker A: 'I went through the latest contract draft, and there are several ambiguities that could present challenges.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, drafting these documents can be frustrating. Inaccuracies often slip through.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and a few clauses seem to contradict one another, which might complicate negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'It’s definitely concerning. We’ll need another round of thorough revisions to iron out these issues.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s discuss our next steps. We need to ensure everything is lined up before the meeting.'

Speaker B: 'Sure. We should prioritize clarifying those sections first and allocate someone to double-check the references.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We also need to prepare for possible questions or changes the client might request.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, I'll draft an outline of our action items, and we can review them together before proceeding.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a plan. Let’s aim for a hassle-free next meeting.'"
