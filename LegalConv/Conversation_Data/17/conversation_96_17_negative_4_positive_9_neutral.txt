Speaker B: 'I understand. It can be challenging and tedious, but it's crucial to ensure accuracy in our negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Maintaining that protection gives us a solid foundation to work from. It allows for open and honest dialogue.'

Speaker A: 'When it comes to the contract details, it's all pretty standard, isn't it?'
