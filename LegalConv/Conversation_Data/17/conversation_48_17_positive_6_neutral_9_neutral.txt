Speaker B: 'Thank you, I always aim to create clear and robust documents. Clarity can prevent numerous issues down the line.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, as we shift towards reviewing the evidence and documents related to the case, how do you feel about what we've gathered so far?'

Speaker B: 'It's fairly comprehensive, but I think it could benefit from a more thorough examination to ensure we've covered all our bases. There’s always something that could be improved.'
