Speaker B: 'On a different note, I reviewed the jurisdiction criteria, and it seems fairly straightforward at least.'

Speaker A: 'That's a relief. Knowing where the case stands helps.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, having clear guidelines on which legal principles apply is always helpful.'

Speaker A: 'True, though we can't lose sight of those tricky regulations causing us issues.'

Speaker B: 'We should definitely stay updated, but understanding the jurisdiction should give us some stability.'"
