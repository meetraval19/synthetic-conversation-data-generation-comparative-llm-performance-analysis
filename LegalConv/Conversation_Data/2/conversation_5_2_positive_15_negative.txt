"Speaker A: 'I’m pleased to see the updated laws and regulations aligning with our current contract terms. It really supports our objectives, don't you think?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the recent amendments have been quite beneficial for our case. It's great to have the legal framework on our side.'

Speaker A: 'That's a significant relief. However, I feel the challenge will come when we start drafting the detailed legal arguments. It seems quite complex.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, constructing a solid legal argument is going to require a lot of intricate work. It’s not straightforward and there could be a lot of setbacks.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, and having to anticipate counterarguments makes it even more daunting. I'm concerned about the time this might take.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. But focusing on the regulations as our foundation may help mitigate some of that complexity. We just need to be thorough.'
