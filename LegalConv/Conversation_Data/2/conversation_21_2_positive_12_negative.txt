Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the recent amendments are definitely working in our favor and provide a strong foundation for our arguments.'

Speaker A: 'On the flip side, though, the compliance review we had last week didn't go as smoothly as hoped.'

Speaker B: 'I know. The feedback was quite concerning, particularly regarding documentation processes. It seems we need to address these issues promptly.'

Speaker B: 'Good idea. While it's challenging, ensuring complete compliance will save us from potential pitfalls later on.'"
