Speaker B: 'I agree, the complexity can be quite overwhelming, and it often feels like they work against us.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, they seem quite restrictive, which makes finding a good settlement challenging.'

Speaker B: 'Maybe focusing on a thorough review of the contractual terms could help us find some middle ground.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds reasonable. The terms are detailed, but at least that gives us room to explore options.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. While the terms might seem dense, a careful review might reveal potential solutions.'

Speaker A: 'Let's dive into the specifics then. Hopefully, we can find a way forward despite the regulatory hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It's crucial to focus on clear interpretations to avoid any unwanted surprises later on.'"
