"Speaker A: 'Thanks for meeting with me today. I know it's crucial to understand the timeline.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. We’ll lay out all key dates once we review the case details. It's important to approach it step by step.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. And, concerning our discussions, how does confidentiality work here?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, your confidence in this process is our top priority. Let’s ensure we have everything in place to move efficiently and effectively with the timeline we’ve discussed.'

Speaker A: 'Great, that sounds like a solid plan. Thank you for clarifying these concerns.'"
