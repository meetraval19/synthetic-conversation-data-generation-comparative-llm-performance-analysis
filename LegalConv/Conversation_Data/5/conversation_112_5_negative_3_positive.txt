"Speaker A: 'Thanks for meeting with me today. I've been really stressed about how long this process is taking.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concern. Unfortunately, legal proceedings can sometimes take longer than anticipated due to various factors outside our control.'

Speaker A: 'I was hoping it could be resolved quicker. Are there any key dates I should be particularly aware of that might cause further delays?'

Speaker B: 'While there are important dates to keep track of, I can reassure you that we're actively working to minimize any unnecessary delays.'

Speaker A: 'That eases my mind a bit. On a different note, how are we looking in terms of risk?'

Speaker B: 'Well, I'm quite positive about our risk management strategy. We've thoroughly assessed the potential challenges, and I believe we've positioned ourselves strongly to handle them.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. I'm glad we have a solid plan.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I’m confident that with the right strategy, we’ll be able to navigate the complexities of your case.'"
