"Speaker A: 'We need to review the timeline and key dates. It's been challenging to keep everything aligned with the constant changes.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, this case has seen too many delays, which can be frustrating. We have to ensure nothing slips through the cracks.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Let's double-check the schedule and make sure all documents are in order for the hearing.'

Speaker B: 'Right. Now, turning to our witnesses, how are we handling their preparation?'

Speaker A: 'We're going through neutral ground here. Our plan is to keep the witnesses informed and comfortable. No surprises, just clear and direct.'

Speaker B: 'Makes sense. Their familiarity with the case details should help, but we might need more mock sessions to ensure they're ready.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, a bit more practice could boost their confidence and ensure they convey the necessary points effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's focus on that while keeping an eye on any changes to our timeline.'"
