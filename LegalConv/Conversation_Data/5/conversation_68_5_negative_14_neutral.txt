"Speaker A: 'The timeline is really challenging. Meeting all the key dates seems almost impossible with the current resources.'

Speaker B: 'I understand the frustration. Deadlines can feel overwhelming, but maybe we can negotiate an extension during the settlement discussions.'

Speaker A: 'That could be helpful, but there's a lot of pressure to stick to the original schedule.'

Speaker B: 'True, but prioritizing effectively might alleviate some of the stress.'

Speaker A: 'What about our witnesses then? Have we finalized their preparation strategy?'

Speaker B: 'We've short-listed potential witnesses, and their preparation is underway. It’s progressing smoothly without major issues.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a relief. As long as our witness prep stays on track, it should support our case.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. A well-prepared witness can really make a difference during negotiations.'"
