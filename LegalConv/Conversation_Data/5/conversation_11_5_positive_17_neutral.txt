"Speaker A: 'We're really pleased that we've agreed on a timeline with key dates. It's shaping up nicely for both parties.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the timeline aligns well with our goals too. It’s reassuring to have clear milestones set in place.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad you think so. Now, moving on, we have the initial drafts ready for your review. How does your team feel about them?'

Speaker B: 'We’ve skimmed through most of the documents. So far, nothing stands out as concerning, but we’re still in the process of reviewing everything thoroughly.'

Speaker A: 'That’s understandable. Let me know if anything needs clarification as you delve deeper into them. We aim for transparency in the process.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, we appreciate that approach. We’ll get back to you with any comments or revisions by the end of the week.'

Speaker A: 'Perfect. That will keep us on track with the timeline. Looking forward to your feedback on the documents.'"
