"Speaker A: 'I understand you're concerned about the timeline for your case. It's quite tight, and there will be some challenging deadlines.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that's exactly what I was worried about. It feels overwhelming to manage all the required documents and key dates.'

Speaker A: 'We'll work closely to ensure everything is met on time, but I understand it can be stressful.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I'm also wondering about the people who will testify. How does that usually work?'

Speaker A: 'For witness selection and preparation, weâ€™ll carefully choose those who can provide the most relevant information. It's a straightforward process, but it requires some coordination.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, that sounds manageable. I was just curious about how it all fits together.'

Speaker A: 'Finally, on a brighter note, the recent regulatory compliance review went smoothly. Everything is in excellent order for your case.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief to hear. At least that's one less thing to worry about.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's great to know we're starting on solid ground there.'"
