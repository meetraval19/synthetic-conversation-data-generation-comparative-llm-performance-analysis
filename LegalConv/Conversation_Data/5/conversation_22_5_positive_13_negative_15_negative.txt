Speaker B: 'That's a relief. However, I'm somewhat concerned about the settlement options we've discussed. They don't seem very favorable.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concerns. The current strategy does present some challenges, but we can explore alternatives to improve our position.'

Speaker B: 'I guess we'll have to see what can be done. I'm also a bit uneasy about the formulation of our legal arguments. Do we have enough strong points?'

Speaker A: 'It's a delicate situation. We need to refine our arguments further, ensuring they're as compelling as possible to strengthen our case.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, let's focus on those aspects. I hope we can turn things around.'
