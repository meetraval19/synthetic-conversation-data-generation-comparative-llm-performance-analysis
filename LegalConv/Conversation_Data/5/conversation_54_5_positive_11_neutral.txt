"Speaker A: 'I’ve reviewed our timeline and I'm optimistic. We’re well aligned with the key dates for the case.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Keeping everything on track is crucial, especially when presenting our arguments.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It gives us a strong foundation. How are we looking on the budget planning front?'

Speaker B: 'I’d say it’s quite balanced at this point. There are some variables, but overall, our cost estimates seem reasonable.'

Speaker A: 'Good to know. We’ll need to monitor any changes closely to avoid surprises.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let’s meet again next week to see if anything needs adjusting on either front.'"
