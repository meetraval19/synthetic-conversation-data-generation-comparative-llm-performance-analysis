"Speaker A: 'I’m glad we’ve established a timeline with clear key dates. This should keep everything on track and ensure we reach a resolution efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Having those deadlines helps everyone stay focused and organized.'

Speaker A: 'On the other hand, I have concerns about maintaining confidentiality throughout this process. There have been instances in the past where information has leaked.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, breaches of privilege can undermine trust in these proceedings. We need to ensure that all sensitive information remains protected.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Perhaps implementing more stringent measures can reassure all parties involved.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. While we have a solid timeline, safeguarding confidentiality is equally critical to the success of this mediation.'"
