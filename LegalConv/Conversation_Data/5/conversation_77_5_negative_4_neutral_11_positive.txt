Speaker B: 'I understand the frustration. The timeline has been far from ideal, but we should focus on managing expectations moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now about confidentiality, do you think there might be concerns about sharing sensitive information during this settlement?'

Speaker B: 'It's a valid point, but keeping confidentiality is standard practice. Both parties should feel secure that privileged information remains protected.'

Speaker A: 'Okay, let's make sure to outline any specifics in our agreement. On another note, how are we doing on cost estimates?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, our budget planning is on track. We’ve managed to streamline some processes, which is helping keep expenses down.'

Speaker A: 'That’s good to hear. Getting clarity on the budget allows us to proceed with confidence.'
