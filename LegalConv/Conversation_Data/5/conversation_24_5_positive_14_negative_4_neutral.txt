Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having clear dates laid out is a big step forward and keeps everyone focused.'

Speaker A: 'Now, turning to witness preparation, I know there were some concerns. Have you been experiencing any issues?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, there have been complications. Some witnesses are hesitant, and it’s been challenging to prepare them adequately.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds frustrating. Maybe we can look into additional resources or support to ease their concerns?'

Speaker A: 'Great, as long as we stay within those boundaries, we should avoid unnecessary complications.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, maintaining those standards is crucial to avoid any potential breaches.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let’s continue with this momentum and address the witness issues promptly.'
