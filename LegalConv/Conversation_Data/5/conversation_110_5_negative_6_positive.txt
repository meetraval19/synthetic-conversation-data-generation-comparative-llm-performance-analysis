"Speaker A: 'We're having some issues with the timeline we've been following, aren't we?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been challenging to meet every key date on such tight deadlines. It’s becoming a real problem.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, the delays have been frustrating. What do you suggest we do about it?'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps revisiting the initial schedule might help us find a more workable solution. It’s crucial we address it promptly.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, let's set a new timeline that considers all necessary constraints. Now, how are we doing with reviewing the documents?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, the document review process has been going remarkably well. The evidence is clear and quite comprehensive.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. Having a thorough review really helps in understanding the broader picture.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it’s been a relief to see everything fall into place on that front.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s keep pushing forward with the document review then, since it’s such a strong point for us.' 

Speaker B: 'Yes, focusing on areas where we're making good progress can really keep us motivated amidst the scheduling issues.'"
