"Speaker A: 'I'm pleased to share that we've finalized the timeline for our case. All key dates are set, and everything is on track.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! It gives us a solid foundation to build upon.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, exactly. Now, regarding our strategy, I've been thinking about a few different approaches we could take...'

Speaker C: 'It’s important to consider all angles. The balance between aggressive and conservative tactics could be crucial.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On another note, I've reviewed the preliminary budget figures, and there are some concerns.'

Speaker C: 'I thought as much. Costs are escalating faster than we anticipated.'
