"Speaker A: 'It's been encouraging to see how open everyone has been in these discussions.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Good communication with the other side has really helped in narrowing down the issues.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, itâ€™s refreshing when both parties are willing to engage meaningfully.'

Speaker B: 'However, going through all the evidence has been quite overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Reviewing these documents feels tedious and sometimes disheartening. It seems endless.'

Speaker B: 'True. It can be frustrating when the evidence isn't as clear-cut as we'd like.'

Speaker A: 'But maintaining open lines of communication can help clear up some of these evidentiary hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, as long as we keep communicating well, we can tackle the issues head-on.'"
