"Speaker A: 'I've been having a challenging time communicating with the other side on this case.'

Speaker B: 'That can be tough. Sometimes they're just not open to dialogue, which makes negotiation almost impossible.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's frustrating when they're not responsive or transparent.'

Speaker B: 'I completely understand. Shifting focus, how's the review of the contractual terms going?'

Speaker A: 'Actually, that's going really well. The terms are much clearer now, and I feel confident about the agreements we're setting up.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! A well-drafted contract can really make a difference.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's reassuring to have everything so well-defined. It brings peace of mind.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Strong contractual terms often translate into smoother processes down the line.'"
