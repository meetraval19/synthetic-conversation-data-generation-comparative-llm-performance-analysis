"Speaker A: 'I’ve noticed that communication with the other side can become quite tense lately.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it can create significant challenges. Misunderstandings can really escalate issues.'

Speaker A: 'True, and a minor misstep could lead to potential setbacks in negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, but have you explored different ways to resolve conflicts?'

Speaker A: 'I have, and I’m actually quite optimistic about using alternative dispute resolution methods.'

Speaker B: 'That's promising. Mediation, for instance, often results in mutually agreeable outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, and it promotes a more collaborative atmosphere than traditional litigation.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it can be cost-effective too. It’s a win-win for everyone involved.'

Speaker A: 'When executed well, it can make the entire process much smoother and less adversarial.'"
