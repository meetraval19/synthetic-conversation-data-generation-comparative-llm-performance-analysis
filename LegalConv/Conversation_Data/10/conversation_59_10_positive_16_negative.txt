"Speaker A: 'I must say, our recent interactions with the other side have been quite productive. Their team has been surprisingly open to dialogue.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's refreshing to have such an open line of communication. It certainly makes the negotiations smoother.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It helps us address both parties' needs more effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Now, regarding the choice of governing law, there are some concerns. The jurisdiction proposed could lead to complications.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It's potentially problematic. The laws there are notoriously complex and might not favor our position.'

Speaker B: 'We should definitely push for a more neutral jurisdiction. It'll be more beneficial in the long run.'

Speaker A: 'I'll draft some alternative suggestions and see how they respond. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground that suits everyone.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a plan. Let's keep the positive momentum going with our discussions while addressing these legal concerns head-on.'"
