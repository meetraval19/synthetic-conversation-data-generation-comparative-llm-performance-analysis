"Speaker A: 'In our recent case meeting, I discussed the key points with the other side’s attorney. The discussions were quite straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Glad to hear that the communication was clear. It’s always a relief when things go smoothly on that front.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, although on a neutral note, it’s all part of the process. Speaking of process, we need to address our client’s main objectives again. They aren’t fully aligned with current progress.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. The client's expectations seem to have shifted recently, and they’re not entirely realistic given the circumstances.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, which might lead to some dissatisfaction if we can't manage those expectations properly.'

Speaker B: 'I’ll schedule a meeting with the client to discuss the practicalities and perhaps adjust some priorities. It's important they're aware of potential outcomes and limitations.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, it’s essential to keep them informed to avoid potential conflicts down the line.'
