"Speaker A: 'I noticed that communicating with the other side has been quite challenging. Their responses seem to be delayed and unclear.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, it's been frustrating at times. It's important we keep our patience, though.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Now, about the timeline, should we adjust any key dates in our draft?'

Speaker B: 'I think the current dates are fine, but we should confirm them at the next meeting.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. Regarding the terms we've outlined so far, I'm really pleased with the progress. They cover all necessary areas very well.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The terms are solid, and the clarity will benefit both parties once finalized.'"
