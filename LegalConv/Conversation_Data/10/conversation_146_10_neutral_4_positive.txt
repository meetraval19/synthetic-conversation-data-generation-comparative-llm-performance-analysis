“Speaker A: 'Have you been able to discuss the terms with their team yet? It’s crucial we maintain clear channels.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, we’ve kept communication open. They’re trying to be forthcoming, which is a good sign.'

Speaker A: 'That’s reasonable. Neutral exchanges often help in smoothing out the finer details.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. On another note, how are we handling the protection of sensitive information?'

Speaker A: 'That’s exactly where we’re ahead. Our confidentiality agreements are rock-solid.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect! Ensuring privilege is respected might just make this process a lot smoother.'

Speaker A: 'It’s reassuring to have that security. It keeps the focus on the negotiations themselves.'

Speaker B: 'Right, having that positive assurance lets us work more effectively without distractions.’”
