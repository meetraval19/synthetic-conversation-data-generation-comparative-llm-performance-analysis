"Speaker A: 'Our communication with the opposing parties has been remarkably constructive lately.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's refreshing to see such openness, and it should help in reaching agreements.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Having that line of communication open makes everything smoother.'

Speaker B: 'However, I'm concerned about the available dispute resolution options.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, some of those options seem rather cumbersome and could slow down the process.'

Speaker A: 'True, we might need to think creatively to find a more efficient path forward.'

Speaker B: 'I concur. We should explore all possibilities to ensure a fair and timely resolution.'"
