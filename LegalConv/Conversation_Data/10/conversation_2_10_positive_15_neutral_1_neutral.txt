Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear. It’s always a good start when both sides are willing to communicate.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it sets a positive tone for the proceedings. Speaking of which, I wanted to discuss how we’re structuring the key points of your case.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I'm interested in understanding your approach to formulating our arguments.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. Do you think our main arguments align well with our goals?'

Speaker A: 'I believe so. Let’s ensure we’re clear on your priorities, so that the legal strategy reflects what’s most important for you.'

Speaker B: 'Well, my main concern is achieving a fair settlement without dragging things out.'

Speaker A: 'Understood. I’ll make sure we prioritize that in every decision moving forward.'
