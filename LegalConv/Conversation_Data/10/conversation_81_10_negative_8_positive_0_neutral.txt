"Speaker A: 'I'm finding it quite challenging to communicate effectively with the other side's legal team.'

Speaker B: 'That’s often the case. They can be quite aggressive in their approach.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it's making the whole process more difficult than it needs to be.'

Speaker B: 'On a positive note, have you thought about alternative dispute resolution methods? Mediation, for example, can be quite effective.'

Speaker A: 'I've heard good things about mediation. It might be worth exploring further to reach a resolution without going to court.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and if both parties are open to it, it can really save time and resources.'

Speaker A: 'I’ll explore that. Now, about identifying the main legal issues, do you think we have everything covered?'

Speaker B: 'We've identified the primary concerns, but it’s important to remain vigilant in case new issues arise during this process.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, staying alert is crucial. It’s always good to reassess as things progress.'"
