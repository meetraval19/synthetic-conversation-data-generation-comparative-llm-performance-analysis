Speaker A: 'Exactly. Every discussion seems to lead nowhere productive.'  
Speaker B: 'It's frustrating but remember, those conversations are crucial for negotiating the best outcome.'  
Speaker A: 'True. I just wish it didn't feel so combative.'  
Speaker B: 'Let's try to redirect those communications towards more constructive topics. We can guide the tone a bit better.'  
Speaker A: 'That would be helpful. What do you suggest?'  
Speaker B: 'We can emphasize areas of agreement first. That might ease some tension.'  
Speaker A: 'Makes sense. Now, about our case, how are we doing with assessing the risks?'  
Speaker B: 'We're in a pretty neutral spot right now. I don't foresee any major surprises.'  
Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. What should be our main focus?'  
Speaker B: 'Staying vigilant. Regular updates on the status will help us remain prepared for any shifts.'  
Speaker A: 'I appreciate your balanced approach.'  
Speaker B: 'It's all about making informed decisions, step by step.'
