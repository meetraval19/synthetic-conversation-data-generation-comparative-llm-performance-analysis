"Speaker A: 'We've been having a tough time getting a response from the opposing parties.'

Speaker B: 'I know, it’s been frustrating. Every time we try to reach out, it seems like we're hitting a wall.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It’s affecting our ability to move forward efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'Maybe we should explore other ways to engage with them.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a good idea. Meanwhile, we should discuss alternative ways to address the conflict. Have you thought about mediation or arbitration?'

Speaker B: 'We should set aside some time to go through the legal frameworks involved.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, understanding those will be crucial for building a strong strategy going forward.'"
