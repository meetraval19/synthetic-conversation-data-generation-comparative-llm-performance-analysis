"Speaker A: 'We've been seeing more effective communication with opposing parties lately, haven't we? It really helps in streamlining negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, open channels have certainly led to more productive discussions. It's refreshing to see such cooperation.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, the discussions about the governing law and jurisdiction seem to drag on. They often create more complications than solutions.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It tends to be a sticking point that slows progress. Jurisdiction battles can be really tedious and frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'And when it comes to dispute resolution options, it's not much better. Many seem to find them lacking or just too cumbersome.'

Speaker B: 'It's true. The existing methods often exacerbate issues rather than resolve them efficiently. Finding a clear path remains challenging.'"
