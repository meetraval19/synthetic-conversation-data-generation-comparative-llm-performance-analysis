"Speaker A: 'I've noticed that communication with the opposing parties has been quite challenging.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it has been frustrating. Their responses often seem evasive, making it hard to progress.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Maybe shifting our approach in drafting and reviewing legal documents might help? Staying neutral, I believe streamlining this process could ease tensions.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Clear and precise documents might reduce misunderstandings and keep things on track.'

Speaker A: 'On a positive note, our client's confidentiality and privilege are well-protected. It's reassuring to see that aspect being fully respected.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. Maintaining strong confidentiality measures is a definite success in this situation. It adds a layer of trust to everything we’re doing.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. If we ensure that these are kept intact, it might open up more cooperative dialogues with the other side.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s hope focusing on confidentiality can indeed pave the way for better communication in the future.'"
