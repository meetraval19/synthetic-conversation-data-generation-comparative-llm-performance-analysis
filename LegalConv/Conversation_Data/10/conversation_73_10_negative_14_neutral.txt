"Speaker A: 'We've been having some challenges with reaching an agreement. Communication with the opposing parties has been quite frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It's often difficult to achieve clear and productive dialogue when tensions are high.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Every exchange feels like weâ€™re hitting a wall.'

Speaker B: 'Maybe refocusing the approach could help ease the tension.'

Speaker A: 'I hope so. Now, regarding selecting witnesses, it seems like things are more straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the process of choosing and preparing witnesses is clear-cut. It's one part of the procedure that usually goes smoothly.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. And having clear guidelines really supports that aspect.'

Speaker B: 'True. Focusing on properly preparing witnesses ensures that at least that area remains neutral.'

Speaker A: 'I'll keep that approach in mind while we continue to work through our discussions with the other side.'"
