"Speaker A: 'I find dealing with opposing parties exhausting. The communication always feels tense and unproductive.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It can sometimes seem like there’s more hostility than collaboration. Maybe we can try a different approach to ease the tension?'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps, but it feels like the trust isn’t there, which makes every step an uphill battle.'

Speaker B: 'Let's focus on areas where we have more control. How's the progress on reviewing all the evidence and documents?'

Speaker A: 'That’s been going smoothly, thankfully. The documents are clear, and organizing them has been straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. A thorough review can really set the stage for a balanced discussion later.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. It might not solve everything, but at least it gives us a solid foundation to work from.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Solid groundwork can sometimes ease the communication issues we’re facing.'

Speaker A: 'Let's hope it helps. We need all the advantages we can get.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s stay focused on the positive aspects like the evidence review. It might help shift the atmosphere over time.'"
