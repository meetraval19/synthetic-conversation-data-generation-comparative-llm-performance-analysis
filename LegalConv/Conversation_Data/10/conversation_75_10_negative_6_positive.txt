"Speaker A: 'I’ve been having some challenges with the communication from the other side lately.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve noticed that too. Their responses have been inconsistent and not very forthcoming.'

Speaker A: 'It makes the negotiation process more tedious when they are not clear in their communications.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It almost feels like we’re spinning our wheels without making real progress.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, our team has been very efficient in reviewing the documents and evidence.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the thorough analysis has definitely given us a strong footing in the negotiation.'

Speaker A: 'The details we uncovered have really strengthened our position.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Having such a solid review process is invaluable in moving things forward. Even when communication from their side is poor, we’re well-prepared.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s ensure we keep our document analysis on point. It’s essential for getting the best outcome.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It’ll eventually help overcome the hurdles in communication.'"
