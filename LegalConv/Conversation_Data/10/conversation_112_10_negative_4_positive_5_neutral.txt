"Speaker A: We've had some tough interactions with the opposing party lately. Their responses have been less than cooperative."

Speaker B: I completely agree. It feels like every attempt at communication just hits a wall, making it hard to progress.

Speaker A: On a brighter note, our protocols on confidentiality are rock-solid. The client's sensitive information is safe, and that gives us an ace up our sleeve.

Speaker B: Absolutely. Maintaining privilege is crucial, and it’s great to know we have that area well-covered.

Speaker A: Now, regarding our schedule, we need to review the upcoming key dates. It looks like everything's on track for the upcoming hearings.

Speaker B: Yes, the timeline seems manageable. Just have to keep an eye on any changes or rescheduling.

Speaker A: Let’s stay on top of it and hope for smoother interactions moving forward.
