Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Their responses have been inconsistent and delayed.'

Speaker A: 'It’s becoming a real challenge. We need clearer communication to move forward.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, but I doubt we’ll get much traction soon. We’ll have to be persistent.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, how’s the review of the agreement terms coming along?'

Speaker B: 'It’s going slowly. The clauses seem straightforward, though there are some ambiguities.'

Speaker A: 'That’s expected. These documents often require a detailed analysis to catch any nuances.'

Speaker B: 'True. And we need to ensure everything aligns with our strategy. No surprises later on.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, let’s keep that steady pace. It’ll pay off in the end.'"
