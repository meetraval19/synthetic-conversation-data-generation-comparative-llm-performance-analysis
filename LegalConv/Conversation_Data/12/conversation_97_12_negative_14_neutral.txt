"Speaker A: 'I think it's crucial we address the regulatory hurdles first.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. The compliance review revealed some significant issues.'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, yes. It’s a complicated tangle of outdated regulations.'

Speaker B: 'We’ll need to allocate resources to resolve those issues. It might delay our timeline.'

Speaker A: 'True, but if we don’t tackle it head-on, we risk bigger problems later.'

Speaker B: 'For sure. Now, regarding our other priority, how do you feel about our approach to preparing the witnesses?'

Speaker A: 'It’s all coming together, although it’s always tricky to predict how well-prepared they'll actually be.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It’s a neutral task, but essential for our case success.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s ensure the preparation covers all potential questions without overwhelming them.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Should we schedule another briefing before finalizing the witness list?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that sounds wise. We’ll ensure everyone is comfortable and ready.'"
