"Speaker A: 'Our recent review of regulatory compliance went surprisingly well; we're in great shape there.'

Speaker B: 'That's excellent news. It's one less thing to worry about as we move forward.'

Speaker C: 'However, the challenge lies in witness selection and preparation. We've hit a few roadblocks.'

Speaker A: 'I heard some are reluctant to testify, which complicates things.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and their hesitation might weaken our stance.'

Speaker C: 'We need to consider alternate strategies to ensure we're ready for any surprises in court.'

Speaker A: 'Speaking of challenges, I'm concerned about formulating the right legal arguments. Some points just don't seem to fit our narrative as intended.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, agreeing on a unified argument is proving to be more complex than anticipated.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps it might help if we had another brainstorming session, focusing solely on refining our approach.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. Let's schedule that as soon as possible. We definitely need to tighten our case before the hearings begin.'"
