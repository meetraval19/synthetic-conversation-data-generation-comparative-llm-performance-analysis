Speaker B: 'I understand, but let's focus on aligning with what our client really wants out of this negotiation. They've outlined clear objectives that we can strive to meet.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. The client’s goals have remained a strong motivator, and their openness to finding common ground is encouraging.'

Speaker B: 'Great. With their priorities clear, we can push for an agreement that satisfies all parties involved.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, and the timeline is quite favorable. Having key dates laid out allows us to strategically plan each step.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the timeline aligns with our approach. It's great to know we have room to make informed decisions without rushing.'

Speaker A: 'Let's keep our sights on resolving these compliance issues, though. It would be beneficial in the long run.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. We'll address those challenges while maintaining the positive momentum towards meeting our client’s objectives.'"
