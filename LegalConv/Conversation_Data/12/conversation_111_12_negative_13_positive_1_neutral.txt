Speaker B: 'Yes, the updates have made compliance more challenging. We've been facing complications that weren't anticipated.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. However, let's pivot towards discussing how we can effectively strategize the settlement options moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good plan. Focusing on a strategic settlement could lead to positive outcomes for both parties.'
