Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! Meeting those requirements is always a win for the client.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it positions us strongly from a regulatory standpoint.'

Speaker B: 'But I’m worried about our strategy development. Some aspects just don't seem feasible right now.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. There are too many uncertainties, and we might need to rethink our approach.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, it feels like we’re hitting a wall with where the case is heading.'

Speaker A: 'That’s why I’m also concerned about our options for resolution. They're not looking favorable.'

Speaker B: 'It’s tough. Negotiations haven't moved much, and litigation seems costly.'

Speaker B: 'Let's gather the team and brainstorm. Maybe a fresh set of eyes can provide new insights.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. We should explore all possible leads and scenarios together.'"
