"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the regulatory landscape for our upcoming case, and it looks quite challenging.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, especially with all the new regulations recently implemented. It seems like a lot of hurdles to clear.'

Speaker A: 'We'll need to address each one meticulously to ensure compliance, but I can't help but feel it's going to slow us down.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, it's not going to be easy. On a different note, have you thought about the cost estimates and budget for this?'

Speaker A: 'I have, and it seems pretty reasonable considering all aspects involved. We need to make sure we're planning for unexpected expenses though.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. Staying flexible with the budget will definitely be key.'"
