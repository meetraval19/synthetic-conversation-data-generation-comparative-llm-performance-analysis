"Speaker A: 'We’re really pleased with how the regulatory compliance assessments have turned out. The team has done an excellent job ensuring everything is up to code.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It definitely helps streamline the negotiation knowing that compliance is on point; it builds trust on both sides.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it’s a strong foundation. As for the overall situation, how do you feel about the risks we've identified so far?'

Speaker B: 'The risks are manageable, but they do bring a level of uncertainty. I believe we've looked at them from every angle reasonably well.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the assessment helps keep things in perspective. It puts us in a better place to address those uncertainties as they arise.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, maintaining neutrality in our approach will be key moving forward. Shall we continue to factor in these elements as we draft the settlement?'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, continuing to address any changes will ensure we handle everything smoothly and efficiently.'"
