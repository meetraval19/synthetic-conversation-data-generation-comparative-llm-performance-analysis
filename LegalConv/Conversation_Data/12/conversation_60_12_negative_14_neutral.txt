"Speaker A: 'I’m really struggling with the extensive regulations coming into force this year.'

Speaker B: 'I get it. The compliance requirements seem to get more intricate every time we look at them.'

Speaker A: 'And the penalties for non-compliance are harsher than ever. It feels like a constant uphill battle.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We definitely need to allocate more resources to stay on top of these changes.'

Speaker A: 'What about preparing witnesses for the upcoming cases? That's been on my mind too.'

Speaker B: 'That’s actually looking steady. I’ve been reviewing potential candidates, and the prep work is going well.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. As long as they are ready to handle cross-examinations, we should be in a decent position.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, we’ll ensure they are well-prepared to manage any tough questions.'

Speaker A: 'It’s reassuring to know we can navigate that part with confidence, even if the regulations seem overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. Let’s focus on balancing both aspects effectively.'"
