"Speaker A: 'We've been making great progress with your regulatory compliance review, everything is aligning perfectly with the current standards.'

Speaker B: 'That's fantastic to hear. It felt overwhelming at first, but your team's guidance really helped.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. It seems like all the groundwork we put into understanding the new regulations is paying off.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but I'm still a bit unsure about the next step with all the paperwork you've gathered.'

Speaker A: 'Regarding the evidence and document review, it's mostly straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief. Is there anything specific we should focus on during this process?'

Speaker A: 'Not particularly. We'll verify the consistency of documents, make sure everything is complete, and align everything with your case strategy.'

Speaker B: 'Great, it sounds like we're on the right track.'
