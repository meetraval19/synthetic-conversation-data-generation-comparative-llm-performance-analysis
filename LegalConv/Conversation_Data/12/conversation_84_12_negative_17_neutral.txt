"Speaker A: 'I can't help but feel overwhelmed with the latest changes in compliance standards. It seems like just when we get up to speed, new regulations come out.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. The constant updates can certainly make it challenging to stay compliant. It feels like we're always playing catch-up.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. On top of that, the complexity of these regulations doesn't make it any easier.'

Speaker B: 'True. It's a lot to manage. At least, when it comes to drafting and reviewing legal documents, the process tends to be more straightforward.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's certainly a more stable part of our work, even if it can be tedious at times.'

Speaker B: 'Drafting requires attention to detail, but at least there aren't frequent surprises like with regulatory changes.'

Speaker A: 'That's a good point. Itâ€™s just frustrating that compliance is such a moving target.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. I suppose all we can do is keep adapting and improving our practices accordingly.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, staying proactive is key. Hopefully, there will be some stability in the future.'"
