"Speaker A: 'I’ve reviewed your investment portfolio, and the lack of diversification seems to be exposing us to more risk than we’re comfortable with.'

Speaker B: 'I was concerned about that. How do you think we should handle it?'

Speaker A: 'We’ll need to consider adjusting our strategy to focus on more diverse assets. Now, regarding your long-term financial goals, the strategic planning is looking quite promising.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! I’ve been following your advice closely.'

Speaker A: 'Your commitment has definitely paid off. We’re on track to meet those objectives. Now, looking at the asset allocation, the strategy there seems to be balanced.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It seems like a stable mix.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, but we should still monitor it regularly to ensure it aligns with any changes in your financial situation.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, staying adaptable is key. What’s our next step?'

Speaker A: 'I’ll draft a more diversified plan and review it with you in our next session.'
