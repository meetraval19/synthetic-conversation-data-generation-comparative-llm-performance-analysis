Speaker B: 'Thanks, I have been focusing on spreading risk wisely. Although, I’m concerned about our strategic financial plans. The projections haven’t been as robust as we’d anticipated.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concerns. The market volatility lately has been challenging for strategic planning. We may need to reassess our long-term goals.'
