"Speaker A: 'I’m concerned about how the recent shifts in interest rates are affecting our portfolio. The rising costs are impacting our returns.' 

Speaker B: 'Yes, the impact has been quite challenging. We need to carefully evaluate the borrowing strategies we have in place to mitigate these effects.'

Speaker A: 'True, it’s all about maintaining resilience in these uncertain times.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and with our strong governance and a cautious approach, we’ll navigate these challenges effectively.'"
