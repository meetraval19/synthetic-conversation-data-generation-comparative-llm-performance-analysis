"Speaker A: 'I’ve been reviewing the current market trends, and the rising interest rates are quite the hurdle for portfolios right now.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The increased costs are making borrowing more expensive, which could stifle growth for our clients.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it’s not an ideal scenario. We’ll need to be strategic to mitigate these impacts.'

Speaker B: 'On a different note, have you looked into the internal frameworks we have in place?'

Speaker A: 'I have. Our internal controls and governance are fairly robust. They’re neither exceptional nor lacking.'

Speaker B: 'That’s good to hear. As long as they provide stability and consistency, we can tackle the negatives head-on.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We should keep monitoring both, to stay prepared for any shifts in market dynamics and internal policies.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a balanced approach will be crucial moving forward.'"
