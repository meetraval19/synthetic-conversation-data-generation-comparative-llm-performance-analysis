Speaker B: 'Yes, it's quite fascinating. Though not entirely good or bad, the impact seems complex.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's important to keep a balanced view on these rate changes.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. I’ve seen people get overly concerned, but sometimes the impact isn't as dramatic in the long term.'
