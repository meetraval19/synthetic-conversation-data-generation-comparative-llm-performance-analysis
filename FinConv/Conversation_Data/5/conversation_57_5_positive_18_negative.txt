Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! We've been working hard to optimize expenses and increase revenue streams.'

Speaker A: 'It shows. The strategic adjustments are certainly paying off.'

Speaker B: 'I’m relieved it’s finally reflecting in the numbers. But what about the portfolio strategies we put in place?'
