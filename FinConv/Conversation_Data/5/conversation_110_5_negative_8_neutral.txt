"Speaker A: 'During our review, I noticed that managing the incoming and outgoing cash has been a bit challenging lately.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the fluctuations in cash flow are quite concerning. It's become difficult to predict and plan ahead.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to address it to avoid potential liquidity issues down the line.'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps reevaluating our expenditure pipeline could bring some clarity and stability.'
