Speaker B: 'Sure, I’ve been tracking the inflows and outflows regularly. It seems steady, but not much has changed recently.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to know. Consistency is valuable, especially in managing day-to-day operations.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, though sometimes I feel it could be more optimized. Any suggestions?'

Speaker A: 'We can explore a few options later. Now, moving on to your risk management strategy.'

Speaker B: 'I’m actually quite open to taking some calculated risks to enhance growth.'
