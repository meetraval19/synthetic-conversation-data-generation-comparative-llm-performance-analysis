**Speaker A:** "Well, from a legal standpoint, everything appears to be fairly standard. There aren't any red flags, but keeping an eye on compliance is always prudent."

**Speaker B:** "That's reassuring to hear. I'll ensure we continually check in on our obligations and make adjustments where necessary."

**Speaker A:** "Absolutely. Regular reviews can prevent surprises."

**Speaker B:** "Thanks for your insights. Let's keep working on this systematically."

**Speaker A:** "Of course. We'll tackle it step by step."
