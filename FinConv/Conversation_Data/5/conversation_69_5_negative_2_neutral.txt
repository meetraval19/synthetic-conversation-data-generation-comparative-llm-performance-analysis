Speaker B: 'Yes, it's definitely concerning. We need a deeper dive to see where the bottlenecks are. Maybe reassess the budgeting strategy?'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It might be time to reconsider our expense allocations, especially with unexpected costs cropping up.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, how are we doing with meeting the latest compliance standards?'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief. Consistency in compliance is crucial, especially with the frequent changes we’ve been seeing.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It’s good to know we don’t need to worry about that aspect at the moment.'"
