Speaker B: 'That sounds concerning. What kind of issues are we facing there?'

Speaker A: 'Mainly, there are lapses in oversight and a lack of clear accountability. It could leave us vulnerable to compliance problems.'

Speaker B: 'That definitely needs urgent attention. Improving the governance framework should be a priority to mitigate risks.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We'll need to closely monitor any fluctuations in the market conditions to adjust our strategies accordingly.'

Speaker B: 'Let's keep an eye on both the internal issues and market projections so we can address them proactively.'
