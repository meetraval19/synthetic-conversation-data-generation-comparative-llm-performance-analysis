"Speaker A: 'I was reviewing our governance structure, and I'm pleased to say that our internal controls are exceptionally robust.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Strong governance is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and compliance.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and it allows us to manage risks more effectively, providing a solid foundation for decision-making.'

Speaker B: 'I wish I could say the same for our portfolio diversification. I've noticed some issues there.'

Speaker A: 'Oh, really? What's been happening?'

Speaker B: 'Well, there's a significant concentration in certain sectors that's not performing as expected.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a concern. Have we looked into strategies to address this imbalance?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but it's proving challenging to find suitable alternatives that align with our goals.'

Speaker A: 'It might be a good idea to bring in some external advice or consider revisiting our risk assessments.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We need to ensure our diversification strategy supports our long-term growth objectives.'"
