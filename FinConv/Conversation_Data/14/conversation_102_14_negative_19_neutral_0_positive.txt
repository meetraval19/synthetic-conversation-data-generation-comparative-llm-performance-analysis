"Speaker A: 'I’ve been looking at our internal structures, and I'm worried about some gaps in our controls and governance.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's concerning. Strengthening those areas is crucial to avoid future issues.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a different note, did you get a chance to evaluate the recent scenario and sensitivity analyses?'

Speaker B: 'I did. They provide a decent perspective, although they feel like they only cover expected ranges.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! Any particular metrics that stood out to you?'

Speaker A: 'Our profit margins and return on investment figures are particularly impressive.'

Speaker B: 'That's encouraging. It’s good to have some positive news amid the governance challenges.'"
