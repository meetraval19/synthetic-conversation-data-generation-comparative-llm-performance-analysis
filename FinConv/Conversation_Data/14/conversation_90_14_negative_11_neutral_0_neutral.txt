Speaker B: 'Lastly, I reviewed our financial statements. They appear stable, but there will always be room for closer analysis.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, maintaining a neutral perspective allows us to make informed decisions without overreacting.'

Speaker B: 'True. It's critical we continue monitoring all these areas closely.'"
