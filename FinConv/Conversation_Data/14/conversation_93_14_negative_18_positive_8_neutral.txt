Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we should prioritize addressing those gaps to safeguard our assets.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, our portfolio diversification strategy appears to be performing exceptionally well.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, a testament to our team’s insights and analysis.'

Speaker B: 'As for our legal and contractual obligations, everything seems to be in order with the current audits. No major issues reported.'

Speaker A: 'Good to hear. We should always stay on top of that, even if it requires regular checks.'
