Speaker B: "Right. A steady approach ensures we’re keeping aligned with our clients’ expectations."

Speaker A: "I'll focus on the internal controls for now, and we can review the risk tolerance strategy in our next meeting."

Speaker B: "Sounds like a plan. Let's ensure we address these issues while everything's manageable."
