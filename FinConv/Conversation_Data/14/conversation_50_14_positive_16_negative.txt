"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to report that our internal controls and governance have significantly strengthened this year. It's really setting a positive tone for our operations.'

Speaker B: 'That's excellent to hear. Strong governance is crucial for maintaining the trust of stakeholders.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, about the recent changes in interest rates, unfortunately, they've been quite a challenge for us.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the impact on our portfolios has been less than ideal. The adjustments required have been quite complex.'
