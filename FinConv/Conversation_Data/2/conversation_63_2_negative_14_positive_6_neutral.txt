Speaker B: 'Yes, I heard about those. Navigating constantly changing regulations can be quite exhausting.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's been quite a task to keep up with everything.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, we've made significant improvements in our internal controls. Our governance strategy has really strengthened our operations.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. The recent audits have shown remarkable efficiency and transparency, thanks to those enhancements.'

Speaker B: 'It's reassuring to see that even amidst the tougher regulatory environment, our internal systems are robust.'

Speaker A: 'Turning to another matter, how do you view our current debt-to-equity standing?'

Speaker B: 'It's fairly balanced. We aren't over-leveraged, but there's room for improvement should opportunities arise.'

Speaker A: 'True, it's stable. It gives us flexibility to explore potential growth areas without immediate risk.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It's a good position to assess future investment options.'"
