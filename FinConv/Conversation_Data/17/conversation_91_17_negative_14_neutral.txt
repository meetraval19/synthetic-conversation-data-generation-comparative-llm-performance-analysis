"Speaker A: 'During our negotiation with the bank, the financial terms they offered were unexpectedly rigid.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that, too. It seems like there's little room for adjustment, which is concerning.'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, flexibility seems to be off the table this time, but we might need to reconsider our approach.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's pivot our focus to strengthening our internal systems. Our internal controls and governance procedures aren't directly related to the negotiations, but they’re crucial in the long run.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Solid internal systems can help in other areas, like ensuring compliance and minimizing risks.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. A well-structured governance framework is always a safe bet, providing stability even when negotiations hit a rough patch.'

Speaker A: 'Let's prepare a comprehensive review to ensure everything is up to par. That way, we're prepared for future challenges.'

Speaker B: 'I’m on board. While negotiations can be tough, having robust internal controls gives us a solid foundation to build upon.'"
