"Speaker A: 'During our review, we've encountered some challenges with the negotiation of financial terms for our latest investment.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It's been quite complicated, and the terms don't seem too favorable.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's important that we strategize better moving forward to avoid such pitfalls.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. However, I think strengthening our internal controls could help us manage these negotiations more effectively.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. Enhancing our governance could provide a clearer framework, making it easier to navigate complex discussions.'

Speaker B: 'Right, with stronger internal processes, we might mitigate some of the issues we face in these negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on that as a priority then. Improving our internal systems might just be the key to smoother operations.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's consult with the team and gather some insights on how we can implement those improvements.'"
