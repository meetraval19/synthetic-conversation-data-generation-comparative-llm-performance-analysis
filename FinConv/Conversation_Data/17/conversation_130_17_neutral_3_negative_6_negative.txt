"Speaker A: 'Let's start by going over the terms we discussed earlier.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I believe the financial terms were straightforward and didn’t need much adjustment.'

Speaker A: 'Good to hear. Now, regarding the credit evaluation, there are a few concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I noticed that. The creditworthiness assessment hasn't been favorable this quarter, which is worrying.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, the scores indicate some underlying issues we need to address soon.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Maybe restructuring some aspects could help, especially considering the current debt levels.'

Speaker A: 'On that note, the debt-to-equity ratio is higher than we'd like, isn't it?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, yes. It’s putting us in a precarious position.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to explore strategies to reduce liabilities or increase equity to balance it out.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, that seems like a practical approach. We should analyze all possible options thoroughly.'"
