"Speaker A: 'I understand we need to revisit the financial terms of the deal. How are you feeling about the numbers presented?'

Speaker B: 'To be honest, the negotiation process has been quite frustrating. The terms seem inflexible, and it's starting to feel more like a barrier than a discussion.'

Speaker A: 'I hear you. Sometimes it’s tough when each side is holding firm. However, I've been reviewing the legal and contractual obligations, and I'm feeling optimistic about them.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear! Legal clarity is crucial. If those aspects are well-structured, it does give us a reliable foundation to build upon.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and having those obligations clearly defined helps mitigate potential disputes down the line.'

Speaker B: 'True, it’s reassuring to know that part of the deal is solid. Hopefully, that positive aspect can ease some pressure off the financial negotiations.'

Speaker A: 'I believe it will. Let's keep that optimism at the forefront and see if it can influence a more flexible stance during the next round of talks.'

Speaker B: 'Fair point. It would certainly help if we can turn some of this frustration into productive dialogue to reach a better outcome.'"
