Speaker B: 'Yes, there were some alarming flags. The company's payment history is not looking strong, which is worrying.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to address this with stricter conditions or even re-evaluate their eligibility altogether.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. Let's ensure our strategies are adaptable to these changes.'
