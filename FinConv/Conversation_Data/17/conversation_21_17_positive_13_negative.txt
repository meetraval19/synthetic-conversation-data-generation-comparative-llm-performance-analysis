Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! Securing favorable terms can make a significant difference in the long run.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. It sets us up nicely for future collaborations too. How are you feeling about the upcoming forecasts, though?'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We might need to reassess our strategies and make adjustments as we get more data.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps focusing more on short-term stability could help us navigate through these uncertain times.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Meanwhile, let’s keep the positive momentum going with those negotiations.'
