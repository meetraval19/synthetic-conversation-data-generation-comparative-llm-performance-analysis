"Speaker A: 'I've looked over the financial terms you've proposed for this agreement, and there are a few areas that seem unfavorable.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. The interest rates are indeed higher than market standards. It's been a challenge negotiating them down.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It might increase the long-term financial burden. Maybe we can explore other options or renegotiate these terms again?'

Speaker B: 'I'll make it a priority to discuss this further with the team, but let’s just make sure we cover all aspects during your regulatory compliance check.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, definitely! I’ve reviewed the latest compliance updates, and it seems like we’ve met all the necessary standards.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! Staying ahead in compliance allows us to focus more on strategic growth without worrying about regulatory setbacks.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It’s reassuring to know that we’re on solid ground when it comes to regulations. Let’s just aim to sort out those financial terms as well.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Having both elements sorted will definitely strengthen our position moving forward.'"
