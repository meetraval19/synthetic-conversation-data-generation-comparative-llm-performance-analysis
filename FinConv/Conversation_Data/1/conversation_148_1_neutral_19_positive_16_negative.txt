"Speaker A: 'Let's start our review with an assessment of your comfort level with investment risks. How do you feel about your current exposure?'

Speaker B: 'I think it's balanced, but I'm open to a deeper analysis if needed.'

Speaker A: 'Great, I find it helpful to run a scenario and sensitivity analysis. It typically brings out potential advantages.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds promising. I'm interested in seeing how different factors might influence my returns.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it's a proactive approach to maximize opportunities.'

Speaker B: 'Speaking of external factors, what about the impact of interest rate changes on my investments?'

Speaker A: 'We'll explore strategies to mitigate those risks, adjusting allocations as necessary to protect your portfolio.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It's good to have a strategy in place.'"
