"Speaker A: 'So, let's start by discussing your comfort level with different investment scenarios. How do you feel about the current approach?'

Speaker B: 'I’ve actually been thinking about it, and I feel positive about embracing a bit more risk. The potential for higher returns sounds appealing.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. Adjusting the risk profile could align well with your future goals. Now, moving on to the next segment, have you had a chance to review the proposed terms?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I went through them. The numbers seem fair, but I’m neither particularly excited nor concerned. They're about what I expected.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It's important that the terms are clear and acceptable to you. If you have any questions or need clarity, we can go into more detail.'

Speaker B: 'I might have a few questions later, but for now, everything seems straightforward.'

Speaker A: 'Perfect. Let’s make sure everything aligns with your expectations as we move forward.'"
