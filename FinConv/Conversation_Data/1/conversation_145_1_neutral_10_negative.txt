Speaker B: 'I’d say I’m somewhere in the middle. I understand that fluctuations are part of investing.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. However, I'm a bit concerned about the fairness of recent valuation metrics in the market.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, some companies seem overvalued, while others are undervalued.'

Speaker A: 'It's certainly challenging, but that's where deeper analysis and research can help us navigate this complexity.'"
