"Speaker A: 'During our risk assessment, I've noticed that our tolerance seems a bit stretched with current market volatility.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, it's concerning. Adjusting some investments might help mitigate these risks.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. We've seen that some clients are uncomfortable with their portfolios lately.'

Speaker B: 'Right, and that discomfort needs addressing immediately. Now, about our internal structures, have you found any gaps in governance?'

Speaker A: 'Not really. The internal controls are quite robust. They seem to be functioning as intended.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. A solid governance framework can really stabilize operations.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Keeping everything in check makes it easier to manage potential issues.'
