Speaker A: 'Reducing the debt burden gradually and considering equity financing options could be beneficial.'

Speaker B: 'Thatâ€™s helpful advice. However, I'm also concerned about the market uncertainties affecting investment risks.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. I'll need to adjust my portfolio accordingly. Thank you for clarifying these aspects.'
