Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! How are those estimates influencing your overall strategy?'

Speaker A: 'We're planning to leverage this positive outlook to expand our investment portfolio. It's a good time to be optimistic.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Now, regarding the current evaluation methods, have you had a chance to assess the multiples and ratios?'
