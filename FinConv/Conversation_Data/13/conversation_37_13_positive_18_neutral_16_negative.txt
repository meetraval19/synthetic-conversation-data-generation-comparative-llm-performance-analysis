Speaker A: 'We should ensure that our portfolio is well-diversified across different sectors.' 

Speaker B: 'That's true. Diversification helps in balancing the risks and returns, though sometimes it feels like weâ€™re just spreading resources thin without clear focus.'

Speaker B: 'We might have to reconsider our approach if these rates continue on this path for much longer.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we need to stay agile and reassess our options consistently.'"
