"Speaker A: 'I’m worried about our current projections for next quarter. The numbers don’t look promising.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concern. The market fluctuations have been unpredictable recently, which complicates forecasting.'

Speaker A: 'It might also help calm some of the anxiety around those projections if we manage terms effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, maintaining a neutral stance in negotiations can be beneficial. It’s about ensuring we're prepared for any market scenario.'"
