Speaker B: 'I agree. It’s crucial to address this issue before it impacts our operations further.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, your profitability ratios indicate efficient management, which boosts investor confidence.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. We aim to keep our profit margins strong while tackling our liquidity challenges.'"
