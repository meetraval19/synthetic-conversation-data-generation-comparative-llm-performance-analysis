"Speaker A: 'I've been analyzing the latest financial statements, and there are quite a few red flags.'

Speaker B: 'Really? What concerns you the most?'

Speaker A: 'The revenue growth is stagnating, and some of the expense ratios seem unusually high.'

Speaker B: 'That's definitely worrying. It might affect decision-making for upcoming strategies.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to address these issues promptly to avoid future complications.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, how is the assessment of the client's ability to repay the loans going?'

Speaker A: 'It's fairly stable at the moment. Their recent credit performance hasn't changed much.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. At least there are no surprises there.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, it's a relief to have that part remain consistent while we tackle the financial statement concerns.'"
