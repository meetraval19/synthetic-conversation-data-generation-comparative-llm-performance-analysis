Speaker A: 'Possibly. We need to make sure everything aligns and consider revisiting our internal controls. How do you feel about the current governance structure?'

Speaker B: 'I think it's functioning adequately, but it's always good to reassess. Maybe bring in a third party for an unbiased evaluation?'
