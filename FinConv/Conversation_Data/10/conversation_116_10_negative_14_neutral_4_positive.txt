Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Some valuation techniques might not be reflecting the current market dynamics accurately.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and that's something we need to address. However, let's move on to our internal controls and governance.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, everything seems stable there. The compliance protocols are being followed diligently.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. It's crucial to maintain strict governance, especially in uncertain times.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, consistent framework always helps in management. What about the performance review of our investments?'

Speaker A: 'I'm pleased to say the returns have exceeded our initial projections this quarter.'

Speaker B: 'That's great news! Some strategic adjustments we made last year seem to have paid off.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Let's continue this momentum and perhaps delve deeper into optimizing our strategies for the next quarter.'"
