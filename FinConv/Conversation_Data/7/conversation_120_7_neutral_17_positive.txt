Speaker B: 'Yes, it seems balanced. Is there any concern about rebalancing right now?'

Speaker A: 'Not necessarily. The market trends suggest keeping a steady approach, so maintaining this strategy could work well.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect. Iâ€™m glad we managed to negotiate effectively and achieve a positive outcome.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's always satisfying to see hard work in negotiations pay off like this.'
