Speaker B: 'I noticed the same. The current allocation doesn't align with market conditions, which could lead to potential losses.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to reassess and adjust to minimize the risks.'

Speaker B: 'Now, about our internal controls, I think they're holding up, but there's always room for improvement.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Our governance practices meet the standards, yet we should consider updating some policies to enhance efficiency.'

Speaker B: 'On the negotiation front, securing favorable financial terms remains a priority. The terms currently in discussion seem fair.'

Speaker A: 'They do, but I wonder if thereâ€™s flexibility on interest rates in these negotiations.'

Speaker B: 'Possibly, though we should maintain a balanced approach to avoid any future issues.'

Speaker A: 'All things considered, tweaking these aspects should strengthen our overall strategy.'
