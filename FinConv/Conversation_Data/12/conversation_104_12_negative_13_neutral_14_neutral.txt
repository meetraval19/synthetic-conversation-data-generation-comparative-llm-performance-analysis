Speaker B: 'You're right, liquidity risk is definitely a challenge. We've seen some assets not performing as expected, which impacts cash flow.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. I think we need a more robust strategy to mitigate this risk going forward.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's shift to discussing our financial forecasts for the next quarter. The market trends are unpredictable, but we have some models that might give us a better perspective.'

Speaker B: 'Good to hear. Maintaining strong governance is vital for keeping everything on track and aligned with our goals.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We should keep monitoring these factors closely and make adjustments as we go.' 

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's schedule regular check-ins to stay proactive, especially with the liquidity challenges we've been discussing.'"
