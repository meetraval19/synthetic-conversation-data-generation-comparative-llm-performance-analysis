Speaker B: 'I noticed that as well. There's a definite need to address the underlying issues causing this.'

Speaker A: 'It’s something we need to tighten up on, indeed. But on a brighter note, our governance systems are strong.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, our internal controls have been praised in recent assessments. They really bolster our operational integrity.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It’s reassuring to see such robust processes in place. Moving on, how’s our cash flow outlook?'

Speaker B: 'It's actually quite positive. We've seen steady improvements thanks to our revised cash management strategies.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. It demonstrates how effective planning can harmonize our financial operations.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. If we continue addressing liquidity concerns while leveraging our strengths, we’ll be in good shape.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, balancing these elements is key to sustaining our financial health.'"
