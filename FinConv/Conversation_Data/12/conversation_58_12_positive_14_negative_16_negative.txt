"Speaker A: 'I’ve reviewed the liquidity risk, and it’s looking quite promising. The current assets are well-aligned with short-term liabilities, ensuring ample flexibility.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear. Liquidity is crucial for smooth operation. However, I do have concerns about how we're addressing internal controls.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the governance framework does seem to have a few loopholes. We’ll need to tighten those to mitigate any potential risks.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It's essential to strengthen oversight to prevent any compliance issues down the line.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it’s better to be proactive. On another note, with the interest rates expected to rise, our debt service obligations might increase, impacting cash flow.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Higher interest rates can squeeze our margins and reduce overall profitability. We should consider hedging strategies to protect against this.'

Speaker A: 'A sound approach. Diversifying our financial instruments might cushion the impact of these rate changes.' 

Speaker B: 'Indeed, being prepared on multiple fronts will secure our financial health and position us favorably in the market.'"
