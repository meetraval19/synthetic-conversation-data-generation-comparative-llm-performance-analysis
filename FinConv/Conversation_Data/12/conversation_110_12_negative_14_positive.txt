Speaker B: 'I agree. Managing our short-term assets and liabilities requires a keen eye, especially now. It’s definitely a point of concern.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, but on a brighter note, our internal controls have been pretty robust.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the improvements in governance structures have really made a difference. The consistent audits and checks are reassuring.'

Speaker A: 'It’s encouraging to see, especially with how it supports our broader strategy.'

Speaker B: 'I think focusing on strong governance helps mitigate some of those liquidity risks too.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a good point. Once our internal measures are solid, it’s easier to handle external pressures.'"
