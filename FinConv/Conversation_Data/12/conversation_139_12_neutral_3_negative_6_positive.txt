Speaker B: 'Yes, assessing that flexibility is crucial, isn't it? It gives us a clearer picture of our liquidity position without bias.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Next, we should discuss the client’s ability to manage their obligations.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve noticed that the recent review of our client’s financial history revealed a few concerns them meeting their liabilities regularly.'
