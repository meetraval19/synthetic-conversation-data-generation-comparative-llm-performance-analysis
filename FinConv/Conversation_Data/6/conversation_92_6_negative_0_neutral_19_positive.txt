Speaker A: 'Agreed, no surprises there. Maintaining that balance is key.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. We should keep monitoring expenses closely.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, the scenario and sensitivity analysis shows promising growth potential.'

Speaker B: 'That's encouraging! It really highlights our adaptability in varying economic conditions.'
