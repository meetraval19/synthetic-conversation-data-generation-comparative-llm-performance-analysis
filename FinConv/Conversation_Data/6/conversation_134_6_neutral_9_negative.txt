Speaker A: 'Moving on, have you reviewed the current tax implications for the upcoming fiscal year?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and honestly, the changes are quite concerning. The new regulations might increase our liabilities significantly.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, it could affect our net income adversely. We should consider strategies to mitigate that impact.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, perhaps revisiting our current deductions and credits could offer some relief. It's crucial to act timely before year-end.'"
