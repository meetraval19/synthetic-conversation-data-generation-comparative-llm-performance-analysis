"Speaker A: 'Let's start by reviewing the company's capital structure. I'm particularly concerned about the leverage; the debt-to-equity ratio is higher than we'd like.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been a point of concern. The increased debt levels could expose us to financial instability if the market conditions worsen.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, we need to address this before it affects our overall financial health. On a brighter note, our valuation metrics have shown some promising trends this quarter.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The enterprise value multiples have improved, and our EBITDA growth is encouraging. It's great to see the trajectory heading upwards.'

Speaker A: 'That should certainly boost investor confidence. Now, regarding our scenario and sensitivity analysis, how does the forecast look under varying market conditions?'

Speaker B: 'Well, the projections appear stable across multiple scenarios, but we'll need to monitor external factors closely. Flexibility will be key to adapting to unforeseen changes.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Continuing to manage our risks effectively will be crucial. Let's make sure we're prepared to pivot if necessary.'
