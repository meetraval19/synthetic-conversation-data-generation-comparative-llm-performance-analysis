Speaker B: 'I’ve been concerned about that too. It seems like there's quite a bit of debt relative to our capital.'

Speaker B: 'Right, it’s all about staying resilient, especially in volatile markets.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, it seems your internal controls are functioning as intended.'

Speaker A: 'Keeping those checks in place is essential for sustainable growth.'

Speaker B: 'It's reassuring to see that effort is paying off, maintaining the stability we aim for.'"
