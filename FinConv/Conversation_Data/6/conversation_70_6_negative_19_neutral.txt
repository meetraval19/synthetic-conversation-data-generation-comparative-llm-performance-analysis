"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our debt-to-equity ratios, and frankly, the figures are worrying. It seems like we're over-leveraged in some areas.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I noticed the same. It's something we need to address immediately to avoid any financial instability.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. On a different note, how do you feel about doing a scenario and sensitivity analysis to better understand our options?'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. It's a good way to evaluate potential outcomes and assess how different variables might affect our financial health.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. This approach would give us a clearer picture without jumping to conclusions.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, it will help us make more informed decisions moving forward.'"
