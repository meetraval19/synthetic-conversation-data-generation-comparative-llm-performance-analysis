"Speaker A: 'During our review, I've noticed that the leverage aspect is raising some concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the debt-to-equity ratio is quite high at the moment. It's something we need to address.'

Speaker A: 'It does seem risky, especially under current market conditions. We'll need to develop a strategy to manage it efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, reducing that ratio should be a priority to ensure stability. On a brighter note, have you assessed the cash flow situation lately?'

Speaker A: 'I have, and there are positive signs. Our liquidity position is strong, allowing us to capitalize on short-term opportunities.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Maintaining a solid cash position gives us a lot of flexibility, especially in volatile markets.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, it's crucial for not just covering obligations, but also for strategic investments.'

Speaker B: 'With a sound liquidity level, we can confidently explore new avenues without immediate concerns.'
