Speaker B: 'I agree; the numbers indicate a heavy reliance on borrowed funds, which could pose risks if the market turns.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's something we need to address. On a different note, have we evaluated the company's ease of converting assets to cash?'

Speaker B: 'We have. The liquidity seems stable at the moment, neither exceptional nor problematic.'

Speaker A: 'Thatâ€™s somewhat reassuring, but we should keep an eye on those ratios in case of unexpected fluctuations.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, maintaining flexibility in asset management will be key to mitigating potential risks.'
