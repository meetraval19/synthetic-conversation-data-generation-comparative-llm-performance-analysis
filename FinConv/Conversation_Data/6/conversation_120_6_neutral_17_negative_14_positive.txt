"Speaker A: 'Let’s start by evaluating the balance sheet metrics. The debt-to-equity ratio seems pretty stable.' 

Speaker B: 'Yes, it reflects a balanced approach in leveraging equity, which is reassuring.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about the terms we’ve been discussing with the banks—they seem to be pushing for terms that aren't particularly favorable.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The proposed interest rates and covenants are not ideal. We might need to renegotiate those terms to protect our interests.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. It's crucial we hold firm on this. Now, moving on to internal controls, I’ve reviewed the latest audit, and the findings are quite positive.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear. Strong governance can really safeguard against potential risks.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it’s one area where we’re definitely on the right track.' 

Speaker B: 'Glad to see we're managing some areas effectively, even if others need more attention.'"
