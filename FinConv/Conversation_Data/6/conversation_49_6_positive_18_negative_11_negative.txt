Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! I'm a bit concerned, though, about our investment mix.'

Speaker A: 'Why do you feel that way about the diversification strategy?'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Let’s ensure we're not overly concentrated in sectors that may be more vulnerable at this time.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. It's crucial we stay ahead and anticipate potential market impacts. Let’s outline an action plan to address these areas.'
