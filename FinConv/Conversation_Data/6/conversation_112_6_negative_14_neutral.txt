"Speaker A: 'During our audit discussion, I noticed some concerning trends in the debt-to-equity ratio. It seems higher than what we'd typically recommend.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I noticed that too. It could be a potential red flag for financial stability, especially if not addressed soon.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it’s crucial to get a plan in place to manage this before it affects our credit ratings or attracts unwanted attention from regulators.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. On the topic of regulatory compliance, how are we looking in terms of our internal controls and governance?'

Speaker A: 'The internal controls seem solid at the moment. There’s been consistency in the processes, and governance mechanisms are functioning as expected.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring to hear. Maintaining neutral performance in those areas will definitely support us as we work on improving the debt situation.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Let’s ensure we maintain vigilance there while taking proactive steps to address the debt concerns.'

Speaker B: 'We should definitely prioritize this in our next board meeting. It’s important to keep everyone informed and aligned on these issues.'"
