Speaker A: 'Exactly, and that might affect our borrowing capacity in the long run.'

Speaker B: 'We should strategize how to balance that more effectively.'

Speaker A: 'This could be an opportunity to refinance at better terms.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, this environment is supportive for growth initiatives as well.'"
