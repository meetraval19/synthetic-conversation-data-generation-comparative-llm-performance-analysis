Speaker B: 'Yes, I've noticed. It seems like we've taken on too much debt compared to our equity base. It's definitely a red flag.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to reassess our financial strategy to balance things out. It's crucial for our stability.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, the current market conditions are quite interesting.'

Speaker B: 'True, the markets have been stable, but there are underlying factors that could change outcomes quickly.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It’s vital to keep an eye on global events and economic indicators.'
