"Speaker A: 'I looked into your debt-to-equity ratio, and it seems a bit high given the current financial climate.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've noticed that. The borrowing has increased significantly, which is concerning.'

Speaker A: 'It's a priority to address, especially as we aim for better financial stability.'

Speaker B: 'Right. On the other hand, have you seen the recent market trends? There's a lot of potential growth there.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. The conditions are quite favorable right now with the economic recovery.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, which gives us a great chance to take advantage of some new opportunities.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. While we need to manage our current liabilities, this market environment is encouraging for future investments.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. If we adjust our strategies, we can leverage these positive conditions for more substantial returns.'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on tackling the debt ratio, and then we can fully capitalize on the market's upswing.'"
