Speaker B: 'I was looking at that as well. The increase isn't ideal, and it could limit our financing options.'

Speaker A: 'True, we might need to explore strategies to improve our equity position to boost investor confidence.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It's crucial to address this before it becomes a larger issue.'

Speaker A: 'Regarding our investment performance, we've observed fluctuations in the portfolio. However, it aligns with the general market trends.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, it's important to keep monitoring and perhaps streamline areas that can improve returns.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, a detailed review next quarter could give us more insights. No major concerns now, but staying informed is key.'"
