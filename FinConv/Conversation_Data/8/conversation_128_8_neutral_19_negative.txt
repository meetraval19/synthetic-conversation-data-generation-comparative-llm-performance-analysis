Speaker B: 'Sure, it's important to keep these aspects in order. There haven't been any major changes, so the obligations are quite stable.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. Now, how about we dive into the scenario and sensitivity analysis from last quarter?'

Speaker B: 'To be honest, the results were a bit concerning. The projections under different economic conditions didn't look promising for some of our key investments.'

Speaker A: 'I noticed that too. It seems like external factors are putting unexpected pressure on our risk assumptions.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We should consider adjusting our strategies to mitigate potential losses should these scenarios play out.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let’s keep a close eye on the market trends and continually refine our approach. Our goal is to stay ahead as much as possible.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. There's always a certain level of uncertainty in the market, but proactive adjustments can make a big difference.' 

Speaker A: 'Alright, let's schedule regular follow-ups to ensure we're on top of everything.' 

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a plan. It's essential to be prepared for any eventuality.'"
