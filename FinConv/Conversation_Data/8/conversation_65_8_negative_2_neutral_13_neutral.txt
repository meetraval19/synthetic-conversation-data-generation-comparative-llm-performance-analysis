Speaker B: 'Yes, legal intricacies can often be challenging. Do we have a strategy in place to address these?'

Speaker A: 'We're working on that. Moving on, the compliance check went smoothly. No surprises there.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a relief. It's reassuring to know we’re on track with all regulatory aspects.'

Speaker B: 'It’s good to see stability, especially in a volatile market. Although, it would be ideal to have more growth.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, stable projections provide a solid foundation, but I agree, growth should be our next focus.'
