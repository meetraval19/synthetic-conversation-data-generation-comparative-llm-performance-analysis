"Speaker A: 'During our audit discussion, I've noticed some challenges regarding compliance with legal and contractual obligations. How do you plan to address these issues?'

Speaker B: 'That's true. We've encountered several complications with the current contracts, which are proving to be quite a headache. It's something we're keen to sort out quickly to avoid potential pitfalls.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, legal intricacies can be tricky, but have you looked into strengthening your internal controls and governance processes? They might help in mitigating some of these risks.'

Speaker B: 'Actually, we’ve made significant progress in enhancing our internal controls. We've established new procedures that are working well, and it's really improved our oversight and efficiency.'

Speaker A: 'That's fantastic to hear. Having robust governance not only supports compliance but can also streamline operations significantly.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We’re already seeing positive outcomes with better coordination across departments and more transparent reporting.'

Speaker A: 'With those improvements, you might find legal complexities become more manageable, too.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It’s a work in progress, but we’re definitely on the right track.'"
