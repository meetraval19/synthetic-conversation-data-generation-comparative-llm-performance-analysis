Speaker B: 'Yes, the impact is indeed concerning. We need to rethink our approach to mitigate potential losses.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Moving on, I’ve looked over the forecasting and projections for the next quarter. The numbers suggest a stable outlook, but nothing too surprising.'

Speaker B: 'It’s important to maintain a conservative view here. We can always adjust as we see new trends emerge.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Now, about the negotiation of financial terms with our partners next month, any suggestions on how we should proceed?'

Speaker B: 'I think approaching it calmly and ensuring transparency will help us reach a fair agreement. No drastic changes expected, just a few minor adjustments.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds sensible. Let’s keep communication open and prepare a solid proposal.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, a well-prepared strategy is key. Let’s ensure we meet their expectations while safeguarding our interests.'"
