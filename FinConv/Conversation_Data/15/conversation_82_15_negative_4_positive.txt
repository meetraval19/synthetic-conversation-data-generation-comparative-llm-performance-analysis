Speaker B: 'That sounds promising! Which areas are showing the best returns?'

Speaker A: 'Your tech stocks have outperformed expectations, providing a great boost overall.'

Speaker B: 'That’s fantastic! However, I’m concerned about the strategic financial planning aspect. I’ve been reading about potential headwinds.'
