Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the way we've aligned our resources has certainly strengthened our portfolio. It's promising to see such growth.'

Speaker A: 'However, when we move on to valuation metrics, the situation gets a bit tricky. Recently, some metrics came in below expectations.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that's been a concern. The current market conditions haven't exactly helped, and it's affecting our long-term projections.'

Speaker A: 'And regarding the negotiation of financial terms with our new partners, I’ve noticed the terms proposed are not very favorable.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Those terms seem to put us at a disadvantage. We'll need to revisit the negotiation strategy. Clearly, there’s room for improvement there.'
