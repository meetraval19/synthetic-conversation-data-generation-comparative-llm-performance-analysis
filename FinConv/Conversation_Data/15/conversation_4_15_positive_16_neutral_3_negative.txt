Speaker A: 'On another note, there’s the matter of evaluating your creditworthiness. I'm concerned as it might impact your ability to secure future loans if needed.'

Speaker B: 'That’s troubling. How serious is it?'

Speaker A: 'It's not ideal, but we can work on improving the situation. We might need to adjust some financial behaviors to enhance your standing.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, let's prioritize that. I want to address any potential issues head on.'"
