Speaker B: 'Yes, the market volatility has definitely taken a toll on the investments.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to consider reallocating assets to reduce exposure to these fluctuations.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds wise. How about the debt-to-equity ratio?'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Maintaining this balance could be crucial in these unpredictable times.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Focusing on these stable elements could help buffer against any future market challenges.'"
