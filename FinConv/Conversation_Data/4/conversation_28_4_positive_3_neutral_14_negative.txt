Speaker B: 'That's definitely good news. It feels reassuring to see the portfolio grow steadily.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. The market has been favorable for our chosen sectors. Now, regarding your credit standing, everything remains stable and as expected.'

Speaker B: 'I see. I suppose there’s not much fluctuation then, which is alright. Stability is important too.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, maintaining a steady score allows flexibility for future ventures. Speaking of which, have you considered our recommendations on strengthening internal policies?'

Speaker B: 'I have, but there are some concerns about implementing those changes. They seem to point out a few critical lapses in our governance.'

Speaker A: 'I understand; the review did highlight some weak spots. However, addressing these will greatly enhance operational efficiency and compliance.'

Speaker B: 'It does make sense. The governance framework needs to be robust to prevent future issues.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Investing in strong internal controls now can save a lot in potential risks later.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let's focus on tightening those areas moving forward.'"
