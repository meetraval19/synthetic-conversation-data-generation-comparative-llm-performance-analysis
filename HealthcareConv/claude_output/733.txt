I'll analyze the conversation to identify the underlying topics from the provided list and assess the sentiment for each.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
