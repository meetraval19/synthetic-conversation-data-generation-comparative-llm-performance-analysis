Based on the given conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment towards each topic:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Care Plan Update",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Discharge Planning",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Therapy Adherence",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation clearly focuses on updating the patient's care plan, which both speakers express positive feelings about ("pleased to inform you," "fantastic news"). 

Discharge planning is initially approached with some concern by Speaker B ("a bit worried"), but the sentiment becomes positive after reassurance is provided ("That eases my mind").

Therapy adherence is implied when Speaker B mentions "working hard on the exercises," with Speaker A acknowledging the "remarkable" progress, indicating a positive sentiment toward following the recommended treatments.
