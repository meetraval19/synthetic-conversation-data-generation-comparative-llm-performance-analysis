Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment for each topic:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Referral Coordination",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
