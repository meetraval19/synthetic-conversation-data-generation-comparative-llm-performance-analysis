Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the underlying themes and performed sentiment analysis:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Emergency Concerns",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
