Based on the conversation, I've identified three main topics being discussed and analyzed their sentiment:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Shared Decision",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medical History",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
