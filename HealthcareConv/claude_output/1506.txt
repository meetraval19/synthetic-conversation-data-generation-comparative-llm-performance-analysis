Based on the conversation, I've identified several underlying themes from the provided topic list and analyzed their sentiment:

```json

      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medical History",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",

}
