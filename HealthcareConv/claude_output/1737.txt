I need to identify the underlying themes from the conversation and analyze the sentiment for each topic from the provided list.

Based on the conversation, I'll identify the relevant topics and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Diagnosis Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Emergency Concerns",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Patient Education",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
