Based on the provided conversation, I've identified the following topics and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Referral Coordination",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Documentation Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers express a clearly negative sentiment toward "Referral Coordination," noting that it's "too chaotic" with "delays" that "slowed us down." 

They have a positive sentiment about "Documentation Review," praising it as "spot on," "clear and concise," and helpful for everyone "staying on the same page."

The conversation also reflects a positive sentiment toward "Team Communication," with Speaker A noting that "our team handled the situation well overall" and both speakers acknowledging how the good communication and documentation made "decision-making process in the moment so much easier."
