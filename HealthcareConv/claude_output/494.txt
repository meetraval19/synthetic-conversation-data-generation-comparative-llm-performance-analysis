Based on the conversation between what appears to be a doctor and patient, I've identified the underlying topics and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Shared Decision",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
