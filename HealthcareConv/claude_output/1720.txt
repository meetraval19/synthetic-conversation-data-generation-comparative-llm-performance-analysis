Based on the provided conversation, I've analyzed the underlying themes and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Diagnosis Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Referral Coordination", 
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Patient Education",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation reveals negative sentiment toward how diagnoses are communicated to patients, with both speakers acknowledging issues and challenges in this area. In contrast, the referral coordination process is explicitly praised with phrases like "went smoothly" and "that's great to hear!" showing positive sentiment. 

Team communication is positively referenced when Speaker B mentions departments working together to benefit patient care. Patient education is also discussed positively, with speakers emphasizing the importance of simplifying language and explaining things clearly to patients.
