I've analyzed the conversation and identified the underlying themes from the provided topic list. Based on the context, here's my analysis:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Diagnosis Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows a negative sentiment toward "Follow Up" as the speakers express concern about patients not attending follow-up appointments and the confusing scheduling system. Conversely, there's a positive sentiment toward "Diagnosis Communication" with speakers highlighting how their new approach to discussing diagnosis results has been well-received by patients and has improved understanding and satisfaction.
