Based on the conversation between a patient and a doctor, I've identified the underlying topics and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Plan Update",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation reveals a patient experiencing fatigue ("I've been feeling more tired than usual lately"), which they feel negatively about - hence the negative sentiment for Symptom Assessment.

The Care Plan Update topic is evident when the patient expresses disappointment with their current care plan ("I was hoping the plan would help, but it hasn't changed much"), showing a clearly negative sentiment toward it.

Meanwhile, there's a positive sentiment regarding the Treatment Plan, as both speakers express optimism about finding new solutions ("I really hope we can find a solution soon" and "We'll work together on that... I'll consider some alternatives").
