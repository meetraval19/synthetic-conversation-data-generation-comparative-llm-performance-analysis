Based on the conversation, I've identified several underlying themes from the provided topic list and analyzed the sentiment for each. Here's my response:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Risk Assessment",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Patient Education",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows a clearly positive sentiment toward Support Services, with speakers using terms like "great" and "positive difference." The other topics (Side Effects, Treatment Plan, Risk Assessment, and Patient Education) are discussed in a professional, matter-of-fact manner without expressing strong positive or negative feelings, thus receiving a neutral sentiment classification.
