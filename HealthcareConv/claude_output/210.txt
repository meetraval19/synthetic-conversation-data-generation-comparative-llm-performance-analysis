Based on the conversation, I've identified the key topics discussed and analyzed the sentiment expressed toward each one.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Therapy Adherence",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers discuss their symptom assessment process with a balanced perspective - acknowledging consistency while identifying room for improvement, reflecting a neutral sentiment. When discussing therapy adherence, they express clear positivity, noting patients have been "remarkably diligent" and calling this "great to hear." The topic of follow-up is mentioned in a positive light, with speakers emphasizing its importance for successful patient outcomes.
