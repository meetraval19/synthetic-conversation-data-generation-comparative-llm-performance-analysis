I'll analyze the conversation to identify the underlying themes from the provided topic list and determine the sentiment for each.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
