After analyzing the conversation between the healthcare provider (Speaker A) and patient (Speaker B), I've identified the underlying themes and their associated sentiments.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Patient Education",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
