Based on the conversation, I've analyzed the topics discussed and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medical History",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers express positive sentiments about their follow-up procedures, noting their effectiveness and how patients feel reassured. They show frustration regarding medical history access, indicating negative sentiment. Team communication is viewed positively as they mention being well-prepared and having a systematic approach. The speakers also implicitly discuss care barriers with negative sentiment when addressing challenges with medical record availability that complicate treatment decisions.
