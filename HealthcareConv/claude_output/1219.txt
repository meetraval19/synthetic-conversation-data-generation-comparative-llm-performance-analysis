I'll analyze the conversation to identify underlying themes and their sentiments based on the provided topic list.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Patient Education",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Discharge Planning",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",

  ]
}
