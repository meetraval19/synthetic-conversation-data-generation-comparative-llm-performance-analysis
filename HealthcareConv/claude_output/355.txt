Based on the conversation between what appears to be a healthcare provider and patient, I've identified the relevant topics and their associated sentiment:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medical History",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
