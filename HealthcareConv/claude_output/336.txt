I'll analyze the conversation to identify the underlying themes and their associated sentiments.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
