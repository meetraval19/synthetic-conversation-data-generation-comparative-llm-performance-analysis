After analyzing the conversation between the healthcare provider and patient during a follow-up appointment, I've identified several topics from the provided list and analyzed the sentiment associated with each:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Discharge Planning",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Therapy Adherence",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
