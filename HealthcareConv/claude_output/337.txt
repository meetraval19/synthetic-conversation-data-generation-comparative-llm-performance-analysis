Based on the provided conversation between a healthcare provider and patient, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment for each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Risk Assessment",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
