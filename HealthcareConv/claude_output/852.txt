Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the following topics and their corresponding sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Care Plan Update",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Shared Decision",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The "Care Plan Update" topic is evident from Speaker A discussing recent updates to the care plan, with both speakers expressing positive sentiments about the new approach.

The "Symptom Assessment" topic appears when Speaker B asks about the evaluation of current symptoms, and Speaker A reassures that things are consistent, which both find reassuring - indicating a positive sentiment.

The "Shared Decision" topic is inferred from Speaker A's emphasis on keeping Speaker B "informed and involved every step of the way," highlighting a collaborative approach to healthcare that both participants view positively.
