Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed their sentiment:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Discharge Planning",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation reveals:

1. **Support Services** has a negative sentiment as Speaker B expresses frustration about long wait times and paperwork issues when accessing these services after treatment.

2. **Discharge Planning** has a positive sentiment, with both speakers acknowledging improvements in the process. Speaker B specifically mentions appreciation for the effort to improve discharge processes.

3. **Care Barriers** is inferred from the discussion about difficulties accessing support services (wait times and missing paperwork), which represent obstacles to receiving proper care. The sentiment is negative.
