Based on the provided conversation, I'll identify the underlying themes and their sentiments from the given list of topics.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Referral Coordination",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers discuss issues with the referral process, noting "delays in coordination" and "long wait times," indicating a negative sentiment toward Referral Coordination. They also address difficulties patients face due to "geographic and financial constraints" in accessing services, which clearly identifies Care Barriers with a negative sentiment. While telehealth is mentioned as a potential solution, the overall tone regarding these two main topics remains concerned and focused on existing problems.
