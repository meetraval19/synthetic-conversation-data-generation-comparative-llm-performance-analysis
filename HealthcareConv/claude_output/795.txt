Based on the conversation about an emergency response situation, I've identified the relevant topics and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Emergency Concerns",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
