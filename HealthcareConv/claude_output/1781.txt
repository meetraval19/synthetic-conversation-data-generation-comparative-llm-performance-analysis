Based on the healthcare conversation provided, I've identified several topics from the reference list and analyzed the sentiment toward each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Shared Decision",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows a positive sentiment toward "Care Barriers" as both speakers acknowledge excellent progress in reducing barriers to care through the new online scheduling system. However, there's a negative sentiment toward "Follow Up" due to concerns about delays in post-visit communication. Similarly, "Shared Decision" carries a negative sentiment as the speakers recognize that patients feel left out of the decision-making process regarding their treatment plans, which they agree needs improvement.
