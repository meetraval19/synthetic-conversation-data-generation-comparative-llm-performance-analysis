I'll analyze the conversation to identify the underlying themes and their associated sentiments.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Shared Decision",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Referral Coordination",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Emergency Concerns",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
