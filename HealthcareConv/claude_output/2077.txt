I'll analyze the conversation and identify the underlying themes with their associated sentiments.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
