Based on the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows:
- Strong praise for support teams managing patient influx ("truly outdone themselves"), indicating positive sentiment toward Support Services
- Appreciation for quick coordination among teams ("quick coordination really made all the difference"), showing positive sentiment toward Team Communication
- Recognition of challenges in interpreting symptoms ("a few instances where symptoms were a bit challenging to interpret" and "symptom assessment can often be tricky"), reflecting a negative sentiment toward Symptom Assessment as it's viewed as an area needing improvement
