Based on the conversation between the healthcare provider and patient, I've identified the relevant topics and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Diagnosis Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
