After analyzing the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Patient Education",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
