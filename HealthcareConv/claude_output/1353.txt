After analyzing the conversation between healthcare professionals, I've identified the underlying themes and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Discharge Planning",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Test Results",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Follow Up",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers express positive sentiment toward Discharge Planning, with mentions of an "exceptionally well" meeting and a "smooth transition home." They show negative sentiment regarding Test Results, being "concerned" about lab results that "were not what we were hoping for." 

Medication Review is discussed neutrally when they mention potentially adjusting "the medication regimen accordingly." Similarly, Follow Up is mentioned with a neutral tone when discussing "managing a few more follow-up appointments" and monitoring the situation.
