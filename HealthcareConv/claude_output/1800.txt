Based on the conversation provided, I've identified several underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment towards each. Here's my analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support Services",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers discuss "Care Barriers" with a positive tone, highlighting "promising methodologies" and expressing enthusiasm about improving patient access to care.

"Medication Review" is mentioned neutrally when they discuss the analysis of medication protocols showing no major deviations.

"Support Services" appears in their discussion of "auxiliary resources available for patients" with a neutral sentiment - they acknowledge the broad array of services while noting varying effectiveness and suggesting improvements.
