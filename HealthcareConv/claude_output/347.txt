Based on the provided conversation, I've identified the main topics discussed and analyzed the sentiment expressed towards each topic:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Side Effects",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows a clearly positive sentiment toward the new medication being reviewed, with speakers expressing enthusiasm about "promising results" and "positive outcomes." Similarly, there's a positive tone regarding side effects, specifically noting they were "minimal" which is described as "encouraging."

However, there's a distinctly negative sentiment toward the symptom assessment process, with speakers describing it as "challenging" and "concerning," noting difficulties in collecting accurate symptom data and expressing worry about the impact on their understanding of the condition.
