Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment expressed towards each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Emergency Concerns",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Symptom Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation reveals negative sentiment toward "Emergency Concerns" as Speaker B explicitly worries about preparedness for unexpected issues, and Speaker A acknowledges this is "an area we need to strengthen." Similarly, "Symptom Assessment" carries negative sentiment as Speaker B expresses concern about potentially overlooking significant symptoms when patients report increased discomfort, and Speaker A agrees they need to "dig deeper" to ensure nothing is missed.
