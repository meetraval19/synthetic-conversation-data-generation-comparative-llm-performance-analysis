Looking at the conversation, I can identify the underlying themes and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Risk Assessment",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Discharge Planning",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```
