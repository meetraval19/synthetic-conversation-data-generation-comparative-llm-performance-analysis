Based on my analysis of the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Therapy Adherence",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Care Barriers",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows a clearly positive sentiment toward "Therapy Adherence" with speakers expressing pleasure about patients sticking to therapy schedules and improved success rates from the new program.

Conversely, there's a negative sentiment toward "Care Barriers" as both speakers express concern about transport issues, lack of resources, and access difficulties, particularly for patients in remote areas.
