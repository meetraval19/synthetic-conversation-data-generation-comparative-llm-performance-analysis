Based on the conversation, I've identified the topics being discussed and analyzed the sentiment towards each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Documentation Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Treatment Plan",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
