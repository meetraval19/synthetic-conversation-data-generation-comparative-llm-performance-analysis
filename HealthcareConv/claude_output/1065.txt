Based on my analysis of the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes being discussed and determined the sentiment toward each topic:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Therapy Adherence",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Shared Decision",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers express a clearly positive sentiment toward "Therapy Adherence," noting significant improvements in patient outcomes and emphasizing its importance in treatment success.

For "Shared Decision," the sentiment is negative because the speakers express concern about the current state - patients feeling left out of their care decisions and not being sufficiently involved. While they want to improve this aspect of care, their current feeling toward how shared decision-making is being implemented is one of concern and dissatisfaction.
