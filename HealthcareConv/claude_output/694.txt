Based on my analysis of the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B, I've identified the underlying themes discussed and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Referral Coordination",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Team Communication",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Medication Review",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```
