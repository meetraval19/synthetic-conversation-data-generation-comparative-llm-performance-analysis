"Speaker A: 'The patient’s symptom assessment went really well. The new checklist seems to be making a difference.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I’ve noticed that too. It’s allowing us to catch more details and make more informed decisions.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it feels like we’re providing better care. Now, regarding the next steps, how’s the process for arranging further consultations looking?'

Speaker B: 'The coordination for referrals is stable, but it can sometimes be a bit slow. Patients have been okay with it, but there’s always room for improving the workflow.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Maybe we can explore some solutions to streamline that process. But overall, the positive feedback on the assessments is encouraging.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It’s great to see improvements in one area. We’ll keep pushing for better efficiency in how we handle referrals.'"
