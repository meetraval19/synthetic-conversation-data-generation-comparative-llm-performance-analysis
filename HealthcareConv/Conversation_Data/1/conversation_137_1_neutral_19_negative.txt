Speaker B: 'Sure, I strive to be thorough and systematic when assessing. It's essential to gather all the details without jumping to conclusions.'

Speaker A: 'That seems quite effective, ensuring no details are overlooked. Now, about the services provided for patients after diagnosis...'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I feel we could do better. Some of the feedback has indicated that the support structure isn't as strong as it should be.'

Speaker A: 'I've heard similar concerns. We need to enhance follow-up care and ensure patients feel guided throughout their recovery.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Improving these services would not only aid patients but also enhance our overall care quality.'"
