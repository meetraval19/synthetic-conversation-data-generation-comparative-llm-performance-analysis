Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It's great to see our assessments aligning more closely with patient experiences. It's quite reassuring for both them and us.'

Speaker C: 'While that's promising, we need to be cautious about the side effects we're observing in the trial. Some participants are reporting adverse reactions.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that's concerning. We should prioritize investigating those reactions further to minimize risks for our participants.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's working well, although there's always room for enhancing our methods, maybe better integration of digital tools could help.'

Speaker C: 'Alright, let's continue to monitor feedback and ensure we address any issues promptly. It's crucial we keep everything running smoothly.'
