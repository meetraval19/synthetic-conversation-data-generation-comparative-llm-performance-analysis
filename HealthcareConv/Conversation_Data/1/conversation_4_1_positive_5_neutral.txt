"Speaker A: 'I’ve been really impressed with how the new method for assessing symptoms has improved our diagnosis accuracy.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the comprehensive checklists are making a big difference. Patients seem relieved that we’re catching things earlier.'

Speaker C: 'It’s a great improvement. Now, regarding the follow-up process, do we need any adjustments?'

Speaker A: 'I think it’s working well so far, but we might need to look into streamlining some parts.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, though. We don’t want patients feeling like they're not getting the attention they need.'

Speaker C: 'True. Let’s keep monitoring for now and reassess next month.'"
