"Speaker A: 'That was a tough call earlier. The symptom assessment process needs improvement. It was challenging to get accurate information under pressure.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It can be difficult when patients aren’t always able to communicate clearly. We need to find ways to streamline that process.'

Speaker A: 'During the treatment phase, though, I felt the decision-making with the team was quite smooth. Everyone contributed equally.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, teamwork is crucial. It’s essential to have everyone on the same page to manage situations efficiently.'

Speaker A: 'And what about explaining the situation to the family? Balancing enough information without causing alarm is tricky.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Clear communication is key there. We need to ensure they understand the essentials without overwhelming them.'"
