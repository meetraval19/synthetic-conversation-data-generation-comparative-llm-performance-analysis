Speaker B: 'I agree. We managed to assess the situation swiftly, and it definitely improved the patient outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'However, I feel disheartened about the support services. There were significant delays in getting necessary resources on site.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the coordination was disappointing. It seemed like the logistical chain wasn't as responsive as it should have been.'
