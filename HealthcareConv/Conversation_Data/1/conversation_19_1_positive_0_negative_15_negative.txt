"Speaker A: 'I think we can all agree that our approach to symptom assessment has really improved. Our patients are responding well to the thorough evaluations.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having a structured approach ensures we miss fewer details during assessments.'

Speaker C: 'However, it's quite challenging when we don't have complete access to a patient’s medical history. It can really complicate diagnosis and treatment.'

Speaker A: 'That’s true. Incomplete records make our work much harder and introduce unnecessary risks.'

Speaker B: 'I often feel like we’re navigating in the dark without a full picture. It's something we need to address moving forward.'

Speaker C: 'On a similar note, the issue of shared decision-making has been coming up frequently. Not all patients are comfortable with it.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it seems like there's a perception that it adds complexity rather than clarity to the treatment process.'

Speaker B: 'I think we need to find a way to make it more collaborative without overwhelming the patients.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed, but until then, preparing clear guidelines could help ease the process for everyone involved.'"
