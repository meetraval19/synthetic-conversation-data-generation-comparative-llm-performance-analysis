Speaker B: 'Yes, I've had persistent headaches and fatigue. It's been quite concerning and affecting my daily life.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds challenging. We'll need to explore those symptoms further to pinpoint the cause. Let’s make sure we address your concerns thoroughly.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It's been pretty overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'Now, moving on to your treatment plan, how are you managing with following the prescribed therapy?'

Speaker B: 'It's been going okay, I suppose. Some days are better than others, but I’m trying to keep up with it.'

Speaker A: 'Consistency is key, but it's important to make adjustments if needed. It's understandable that it can be tough to stick to it all the time.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I think just staying on track is the hardest part, especially on rough days.'

Speaker A: 'We can work together to find strategies that might help. Let’s focus on finding a balance that works for you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. I really want to stay on top of this.'"
