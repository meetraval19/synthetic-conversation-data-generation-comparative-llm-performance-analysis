"Speaker A: 'I’ve been feeling a bit worse than last time, with more persistent fatigue and headaches.'

Speaker B: 'I understand that those symptoms can be quite distressing. Let’s go through them carefully to see if we can find some relief.'

Speaker A: 'That would be great. The headaches especially are becoming quite a bother.'

Speaker B: 'For the headaches, have you noticed any particular triggers or changes in your daily routine that might be contributing?'

Speaker A: 'Not really, it just seems to be more frequent. Could it be related to something else?'

Speaker B: 'Possibly. Let’s ensure we cover all angles. As for the diagnosis from your last visit, it’s still consistent with what we discussed. There's nothing new in the recent tests that adds to our initial understanding.'

Speaker A: 'I see, so there’s no major change?'

Speaker B: 'Correct. The results are stable. The focus should remain on managing your symptoms effectively for now.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. I appreciate your thoroughness.'

Speaker B: 'Of course, keeping you informed and comfortable is our main goal.'"
