"Speaker A: 'Let's go over the patient's treatment plan. It seems we have several options available.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the options are clear, but following through on appointments has been a challenge. Many patients find the process overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. The follow-up process could definitely use improvement. Patients often express frustration with how complicated it can be.'

Speaker B: 'And on top of that, coordinating referrals is another hurdle. Communication between departments seems to always hit snags.'

Speaker B: 'I think addressing these issues will require a comprehensive review of our coordination protocols.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Improving these areas would significantly enhance patient experience overall.'"
