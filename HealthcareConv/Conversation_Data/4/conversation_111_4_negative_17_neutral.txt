Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been tough managing the side effects. I feel like it's not working as well as we'd hoped.'

Speaker A: 'I see. It's important to have regular check-ins to monitor progress, but scheduling can be a challenge around here.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it feels like it's harder to get the support I need.'

Speaker A: 'Let's look at alternative ways to ensure you're well-supported between visits. Maybe more frequent phone consultations could help.'"
