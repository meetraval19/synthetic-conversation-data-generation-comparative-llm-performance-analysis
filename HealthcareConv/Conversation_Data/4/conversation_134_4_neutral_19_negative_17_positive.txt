"Speaker A: 'Let's go over your treatment plan before discharge. Everything is set, and it looks like things are on track.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, the plan seems straightforward, but what about aftercare?'

Speaker A: 'We have support services available, although I must admit, they can be a bit difficult to navigate sometimes.'

Speaker B: 'I've heard about that. It can be frustrating not getting the help that's needed quickly.'

Speaker A: 'On the bright side, we've been working on reducing care barriers. Access to resources has definitely improved over time.'

Speaker B: 'That's encouraging to hear. Itâ€™s good to know things are getting better in some areas.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We'll do our best to make the transition as smooth as possible for you.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks. I appreciate that, knowing the improvements will make a difference in my recovery.'"
