Speaker B: 'That sounds great! Having a personalized approach does make me feel more hopeful.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We believe this plan will significantly improve your health outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'I really appreciate that. However, I’m slightly concerned about what happens after I leave the hospital. Discharge planning seems a bit overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I’m just worried about managing everything on my own.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll work closely with the home care team to ensure everything is in place before you leave.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a relief. I’m also nervous about the potential side effects of the treatment.'

Speaker A: 'It’s completely normal to feel that way. We’ll monitor you closely to manage any adverse reactions.'

Speaker B: 'I’m grateful for the support. It’s comforting to know I won’t have to deal with them alone.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Our priority is your safety and well-being throughout this process.'"
