Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. I appreciate you exploring options with me.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about understanding your condition better, do you feel the materials and guidance provided have been useful?'

Speaker B: 'They're informative, though sometimes it's a lot to absorb at once.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good idea, thank you.'

Speaker A: 'Lastly, regarding your plans for going home, have you gone over the steps and resources available?'
