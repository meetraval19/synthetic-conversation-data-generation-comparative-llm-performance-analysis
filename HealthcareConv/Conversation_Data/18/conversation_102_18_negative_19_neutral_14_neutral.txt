"Speaker A: 'I've been feeling a bit anxious since my recent hospital visit. It was an emergency situation.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds stressful. Emergency visits can be really overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. I'm worried about it happening again.'

Speaker B: 'It's understandable. Let's talk about some support services available to help manage any ongoing concerns you might have.'

Speaker A: 'That would be helpful. I wasn't aware there were options outside of normal check-ups.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, there are groups and resources dedicated to providing the assistance you need.'

Speaker A: 'I'll definitely explore those. I've also been noticing some side effects from the new medication.'

Speaker B: 'Side effects can vary from person to person. Have they been frequent?'

Speaker A: 'Not too frequent, but certainly noticeable.'

Speaker B: 'Let's monitor them closely. Adjustments might be necessary if they persist.'
