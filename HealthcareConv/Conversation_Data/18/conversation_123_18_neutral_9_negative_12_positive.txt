"Speaker A: 'So, we’re ready to discuss your discharge today. Let’s address any immediate concerns. How are you feeling overall?'

Speaker B: 'I’m feeling okay. Nothing urgent is worrying me right now, but I'd like to ensure we cover everything.'

Speaker A: 'Great. It’s important to have clarity. Now, I’ve reviewed your risk assessment, and while it looks mostly fine, we should discuss a couple of potential issues.'

Speaker B: 'I was worried about that. What should I be particularly cautious about once I'm home?'

Speaker A: 'We need to monitor any unusual symptoms closely. Remember, it’s better to be safe and get checked out if something doesn’t seem right.'

Speaker B: 'Understood. I'll keep an eye out for anything unexpected.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, I’ve gone through your documentation with you, and everything is quite thorough. It should make your aftercare much smoother.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring to hear. Knowing that all the paperwork is in order gives me peace of mind.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and if you have any questions later, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I appreciate all the support and guidance you've provided.'"
