"Speaker A: 'Before we discharge you, let's quickly go over any concerns about your recent emergency visit.'

Speaker B: 'I guess everything went smoothly this time, no major issues to discuss.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. Now, on to your medications. We've reviewed them, and everything looks promising for your recovery.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad the new meds seem to be working well. The last ones weren't as effective.'

Speaker A: 'It's great to see you're responding positively. Lastly, let's talk about your treatment plan moving forward. We encourage a collaborative approach, but sometimes it can be challenging.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's been tough to feel like my preferences are fully considered in the decision-making process.'

Speaker A: 'We definitely want to ensure you're comfortable with the plan. We'll work on improving that aspect for sure.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate it. Hopefully, next time it feels more like a partnership.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and we'll continue supporting you throughout your recovery journey.'"
