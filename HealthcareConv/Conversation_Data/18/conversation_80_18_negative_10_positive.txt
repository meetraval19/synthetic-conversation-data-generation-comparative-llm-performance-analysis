"Speaker A: 'I wanted to discuss the handling of urgent cases in the ER recently. Feedback has been less than favorable.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, there have been some challenges with overcrowding and wait times. It's something we're actively working on to improve.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, I'm really impressed with how our patients have been adhering to their therapy regimens.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the new reminder system seems to really encourage them to stick to their plans and follow through.'

Speaker A: 'That's definitely a positive change. If only we could translate some of that success to manage emergency situations better.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Weâ€™re looking into optimizing triage protocols and increasing staff during peak hours to address those issues.'
