"Speaker A: 'I noticed you had a bit of a scare last month. How have things been since then?'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, that was a bit unsettling. Thankfully, no more unexpected trips to the ER.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. It can be quite overwhelming dealing with those emergencies. Let's try to keep those at bay.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, though the detailed instructions you provided really helped in managing things better.'

Speaker A: 'Great! Understanding what to look for and how to respond can really make a difference.'

Speaker B: 'I do appreciate the comprehensive breakdown you gave me about what to monitor at home.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad it was helpful. It’s always important to be informed about your own health.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. And if it’s okay, could we discuss how the follow-ups will be scheduled from here?'

Speaker A: 'Certainly. We’ll plan to meet every three months to keep an eye on everything.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. It’ll give me peace of mind to know there’s a routine check in place.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, we want to ensure everything remains stable and address any concerns as they come up.'"
