"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to see you're feeling better. Let's go over your discharge plan.' 

Speaker B: 'Sure, itâ€™s a relief to think about going home soon. What should I expect?'

Speaker A: 'The team has put together a solid plan to support your recovery at home. We've arranged follow-up visits and you'll have access to resources if needed.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reassuring. But, I still have some concerns from the last time I had to visit the ER.'

Speaker A: 'Understandably. We can review the signs you should watch for, just in case something unusual comes up.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. I just want to avoid any surprises.' 

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, regarding your ongoing treatment, there might be some changes needed.'

Speaker B: 'I was hoping the treatment would stay the same. Adjusting has been tough already.'

Speaker A: 'I know it's challenging. We're working on finding the best approach that suits your needs without added stress.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, I'll try to stay open to the changes. Thanks for keeping me informed.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Remember, our goal is to make your transition as smooth as possible. You can always reach out if you have questions.'"
