"Speaker A: 'How have you been feeling since your last visit? Any new concerns that cropped up unexpectedly?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, I've been happy with how things were handled when I needed urgent care last month. Everything went smoothly and promptly.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear! We strive to make emergency situations as stress-free as possible. Now, how about we go over your current prescriptions?'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I've been taking them as directed. Nothing seems out of the ordinary, but I'm curious if there's anything I should be watching out for.'

Speaker A: 'We'll do a quick review of them today to ensure everything's in order and address any questions. It's always good to stay informed about what you're taking.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, that sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to making sure everything's just right.'
