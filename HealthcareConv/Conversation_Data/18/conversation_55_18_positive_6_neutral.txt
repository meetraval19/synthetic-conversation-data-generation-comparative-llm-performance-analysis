Speaker A: 'Switching gears a bit, how’s the current process for coordinating referrals?'

Speaker B: 'Well, it’s working smoothly in terms of getting patients to the specialists they need. There hasn’t been much change, but it's consistent. What do you think?'

Speaker A: 'Consistency is key, I suppose. Though there’s always room for improving communication between departments.'
