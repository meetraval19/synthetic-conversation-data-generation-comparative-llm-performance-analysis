"Speaker A: 'It's great news that your overall condition has improved, and you're ready for discharge. The emergency care you received was effective.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the team was fantastic. I'm glad we got the situation under control quickly.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about the next steps. We'll need to make a detailed plan. I know some decisions might feel overwhelming, but we'll work through them together.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that, but I did feel a bit left out of the loop initially about some choices.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Let's make sure you're fully involved in all future decisions, and I’ll address any lingering concerns you have right now.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you, that would mean a lot. I just want to make sure I understand everything before I leave.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we’ll take some time to discuss everything thoroughly. Your comfort and understanding are our priorities.'"
