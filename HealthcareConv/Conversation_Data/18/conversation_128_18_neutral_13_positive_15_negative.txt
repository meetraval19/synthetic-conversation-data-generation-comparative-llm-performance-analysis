"Speaker A: 'I understand you've been worried about the situation over the weekend, but thankfully, everything remained stable.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it was concerning at first, but I'm glad there were no emergencies.'

Speaker A: 'We can move forward now with planning your discharge. We've made good progress, and your recovery is on track.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. I'm eager to get home and continue recovering there.'

Speaker A: 'We'll ensure you have all the resources you need once you're home, and you’ll have follow-up appointments scheduled.'

Speaker B: 'I do appreciate that. I did want to discuss some of the decisions about my ongoing care, though.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, but keep in mind these plans are guided by best practices. Your health is our primary focus.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, but sometimes it feels like I don't have much say in these decisions.'

Speaker A: 'I see where you’re coming from. Let’s make sure we address any concerns you have so we can work together on this.'"
