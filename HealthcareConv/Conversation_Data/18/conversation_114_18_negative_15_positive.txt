"Speaker A: 'I know there were some initial worries when you came into the hospital. How are you feeling about the symptoms you experienced?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I was really scared at first. The sudden symptoms were pretty alarming, and I was worried about something serious.'

Speaker A: 'That’s completely understandable. It was important to address those concerns quickly. Now that we've stabilized things, we can focus on your discharge plan.'

Speaker B: 'I’m relieved to hear that, and I appreciate how the team took my concerns seriously.'

Speaker A: 'Our goal is always to ensure you're comfortable and informed. Let’s talk about the next steps. Since your condition has improved, we can discuss how you’d like to proceed with your care at home.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds good. I’d like to be involved in deciding what works best for my routine and lifestyle.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, that's what we aim for—making these decisions together so you have a say in your health journey.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks for including me in these discussions. It makes me feel more secure about going home.'

Speaker A: 'It’s great that you feel that way. We’ll make sure you have all the support and resources you need once you’re discharged.'"
