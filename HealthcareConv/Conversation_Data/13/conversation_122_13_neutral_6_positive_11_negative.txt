"Speaker A: 'So, we're looking at potentially discharging you by the end of the week. How do you feel about that timeline?'

Speaker B: 'It sounds reasonable. I just want to make sure everything’s in place for when I leave.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. We'll ensure that all your needs are coordinated, especially with your follow-up appointments. I've seen patients benefit a lot from our referral system.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. I've heard positive things about how smoothly referrals have been handled lately.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. However, there's something we need to discuss regarding your understanding of the prescribed medications.'

Speaker B: 'Ah, yes. I'm actually finding it a bit overwhelming to keep track of all the information.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Many patients feel the same way. Let’s take some time to go over everything, step by step, to make it more manageable for you.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you, I appreciate that. It’s quite a bit to absorb all at once.'

Speaker A: 'It's our priority to ensure you feel confident about your care, both here and once you're home.'"
