"Speaker A: 'So, let's start by discussing your upcoming discharge. It looks like everything is in order for next week.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I’ve been going over the plan. It seems straightforward enough.'

Speaker A: 'That’s good to hear. We’ve outlined your medication schedule and follow-up appointments.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. However, I’m a bit concerned about the next steps once I’m home.'

Speaker A: 'Understandably so. Did you have a chance to review the support services available?'

Speaker B: 'I did, but I was disappointed. The availability of home care options is much less than I expected.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. It can be challenging to arrange adequate support, given the current demand.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. A lot of people seem to be struggling with this, and it’s worrying.'

Speaker A: 'I’ll do my best to connect you with any additional resources that might help.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. It’s reassuring to know there’s someone looking out for me as I transition back home.'"
