"Speaker A: 'So, let's go over your discharge plan. We want to ensure everything is in place for a smooth transition home.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, it sounds like there are a few steps involved?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, just a checklist to make sure you have your medications, follow-up appointments, and any home care services lined up.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. I appreciate the clarity.'

Speaker A: 'And in case of any urgent issues, our emergency contact procedures are pretty robust.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring to hear. It gives me confidence that there's support if something unexpected comes up.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and remember, we're just a call away if you need anything after you leave.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, knowing there's a safety net really helps. Iâ€™m ready to head home with peace of mind.'"
