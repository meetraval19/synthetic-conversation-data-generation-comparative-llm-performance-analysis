Speaker B: 'Absolutely, everything was prepared well in advance, which made the transition seamless.'

Speaker A: 'It’s always satisfying to see our efforts in coordinating care pay off positively.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. However, I think we need to touch on how the communication among our team could be improved.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. A more systematic way of updating could prevent any potential oversights.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, our main goal should always be to enhance our team's cohesiveness.'
