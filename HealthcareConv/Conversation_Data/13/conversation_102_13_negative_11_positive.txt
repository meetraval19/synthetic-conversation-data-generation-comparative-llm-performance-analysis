"Speaker A: 'I know you're eager to leave the hospital, but there are still a few concerns about your discharge plan.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Is there anything specific that's causing the delay?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we need to ensure all your post-hospital medications are sorted, and that's been a bit tricky.'

Speaker B: 'That's a bit frustrating, but I guess it's important to get it right.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a brighter note, we've got some great resources for you to learn more about managing your condition at home.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, that's reassuring to hear. I really want to be proactive about my recovery.'

Speaker A: 'We're here to support you with that. The educational materials are designed to be straightforward and really helpful.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds perfect, thank you for making sure I have what I need to succeed once I'm home.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, we're committed to setting you up for the best possible recovery and ongoing health.'"
