Speaker B: 'I was hoping to leave soon. Is there a problem?'

Speaker A: 'Well, we need to ensure you have the right support and follow-up care. It’s crucial for your recovery and unfortunately, things aren’t fully coordinated yet.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. I just want to make sure everything is okay once I’m home.'

Speaker B: 'Sometimes I do worry about unexpected symptoms. I just want to be prepared in case of emergencies.'

Speaker A: 'That’s completely normal. We’ll provide you with a detailed plan on what to do if you notice anything concerning. It’s best to be informed and ready.'

Speaker B: 'That would really help ease my mind. Thank you for focusing on that during our discussion.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, your peace of mind is important to us. Let’s go through everything step by step.'"
