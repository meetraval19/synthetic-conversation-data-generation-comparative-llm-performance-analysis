"Speaker A: 'I've reviewed your discharge summary and have some concerns about the process.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. What worries you specifically about leaving the hospital?'

Speaker A: 'I'm worried about not having enough support at home and the transition itself.'

Speaker B: 'That's completely understandable. We can arrange for a follow-up call and provide contact details for local support services to ease that transition.'

Speaker A: 'Thank you. On another note, I did feel quite optimistic about the treatment plan you outlined during our last meeting.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad to hear that. We've designed it to be both effective and manageable, so you should feel confident moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'It's reassuring to know there are concrete steps in place. What can I do to actively support the process?'

Speaker B: 'Staying engaged and sticking to the routine we discussed will make a big difference. Weâ€™re here for any questions or adjustments you might need.'"
