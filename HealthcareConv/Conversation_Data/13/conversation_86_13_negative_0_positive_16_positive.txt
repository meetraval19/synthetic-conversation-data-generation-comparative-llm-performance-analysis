"Speaker A: 'I understand you're getting ready for discharge today. How are you feeling about the plan?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I'm a bit concerned. The instructions seemed a bit rushed and unclear. I don't feel fully prepared.'

Speaker A: 'I can see how that would be frustrating. Let’s go over your plan again to make sure everything is clear.'

Speaker B: 'That would really help, thank you. On a brighter note, reviewing my medical history showed some positive progress, right?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely! Your recovery has been impressive, and it’s great to see such improvement.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief! And I must say, the way the doctor explained everything about my condition was really helpful. It made everything so much more understandable.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. Clear communication is crucial, and we strive to ensure all patients feel informed about their diagnosis.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks. I feel more confident about my treatment moving forward. Let’s just tackle that discharge plan, so I feel ready to manage at home.'"
