"Speaker A: 'So, let's talk about your discharge plan. There are a few things we need to address before you leave.'

Speaker B: 'I was hoping it would go smoothly, but what are the concerns?'

Speaker A: 'There have been some delays with arranging the necessary at-home support services. It’s been a bit frustrating handling the logistics.'

Speaker B: 'I see. That sounds a bit complicated. Is there anything I can do to help speed things up?'

Speaker A: 'We’re doing our best from here, but I’ll keep you updated. Now, onto your medication review. We've made sure everything is streamlined and you've got a clear schedule. That's definitely a positive outcome.'

Speaker B: 'Great! I was a bit worried about managing all the prescriptions.'

Speaker A: 'We've made sure it’s easy to follow, and you understand which medications are essential. Plus, the pharmacist has included helpful notes.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring to hear. And what about our next steps?'

Speaker A: 'The follow-up appointments are all set. You’ve got a solid support system lined up to ensure everything continues on track.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds perfect. I feel much more comfortable knowing there's a plan moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and feel free to contact us if you need anything before the follow-up.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I appreciate all the help and guidance during this process.'"
