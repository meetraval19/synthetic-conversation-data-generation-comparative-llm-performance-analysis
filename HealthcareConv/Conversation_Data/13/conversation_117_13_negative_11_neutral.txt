"Speaker A: 'I hope you've been feeling better since your discharge. How has it been adjusting back home?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it’s been a bit overwhelming. The discharge process felt rushed, and I wasn’t quite prepared.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. Discharge planning should have been more supportive. Let’s make sure we address any issues.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you, I’d appreciate that. I’ve been trying to keep up with all the new information about managing my condition.'

Speaker A: 'Managing your health can be a lot to take in. How have you found the educational materials you were given?'

Speaker B: 'They're informative, but it feels like there’s a lot to process. I’m not sure I grasp everything entirely.'

Speaker A: 'That’s understandable. We can go through any questions you have today and clarify things for you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right.'

Speaker A: 'We’re here to support you. Let’s go over everything step by step, to ensure you’re comfortable with the care plan moving forward.'"
