"Speaker A: 'We’re all set for your discharge today. The team has coordinated everything quite well to ensure a smooth transition home.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear. I’m really looking forward to getting back to my normal routine. How has the communication been among the team regarding my care?'

Speaker A: 'The team has been in regular contact to keep everything aligned. There have been updates across different departments to ensure everyone is on the same page about your needs.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reassuring. I was a bit worried because sometimes too many departments are involved, and things can get mixed up.'

Speaker A: 'Understandably so, but we’ve made concerted efforts to make the process as streamlined as possible. Your care plan has been reviewed multiple times to avoid any confusion.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It’s comforting to know that there’s been consistency and that everything is set for today.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We want to make sure you feel supported every step of the way. Let us know if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss before you leave.' 

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I feel pretty confident with the plan and I’m ready to head home.'"
