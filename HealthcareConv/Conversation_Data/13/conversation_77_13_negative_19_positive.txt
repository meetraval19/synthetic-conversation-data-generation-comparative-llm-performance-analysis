"Speaker A: 'I understand you're concerned about leaving the hospital so soon. The discharge process can sometimes feel a bit rushed.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I'm still worried about managing my medication and follow-ups on my own.'

Speaker A: 'That's completely understandable. However, we have a great team ready to support you. The home care services will provide regular check-ins.'

Speaker B: 'That does make me feel a bit better, knowing there's support in place.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Plus, our community health workers are only a call away if you need assistance with anything else.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It's good to know I won't be navigating this alone.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, and we'll also coordinate with your primary care provider to ensure everything transitions smoothly.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. It's reassuring to have all these resources available after discharge.'"
