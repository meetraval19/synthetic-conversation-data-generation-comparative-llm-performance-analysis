Speaker B: 'You're right. Patients often report feeling confused about aftercare instructions, which definitely needs improvement.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it's essential for their recovery process.'

Speaker B: 'We should probably revisit how we handle that part and look for ways to streamline it.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, regarding the documentation, how's the review looking?'

Speaker B: 'It's fairly consistent. There's always room for better clarity, but overall, the records are complete.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. Accurate documentation is crucial for both patient safety and legal compliance.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, and while it's not perfect, it's functioning well enough for now.'

Speaker A: 'Letâ€™s keep an eye on it, though, to ensure it remains that way.'"
