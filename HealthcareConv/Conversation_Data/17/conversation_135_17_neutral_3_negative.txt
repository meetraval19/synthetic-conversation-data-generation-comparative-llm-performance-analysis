Speaker B: 'Yes, it's crucial to understand both logistical and systemic issues so we can better coordinate.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Addressing these issues neutrally helps us focus on solutions rather than assigning blame.'

Speaker C: 'On another note, the recent medication review highlighted some concerns.'

Speaker C: 'We need to address this promptly and find alternative solutions for those affected.'
