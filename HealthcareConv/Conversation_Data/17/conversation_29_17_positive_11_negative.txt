Speaker B: 'That's great news! Overcoming those obstacles has been a long-standing challenge.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, collaboration between clinics and communities is really making a difference.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, I've noticed some issues with how we're communicating important information to patients.'
