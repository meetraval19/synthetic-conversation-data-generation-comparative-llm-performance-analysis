"Speaker A: 'I understand you've had some challenges accessing your medication recently. Could you tell me more about those barriers?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been quite frustrating. The insurance process seems to always delay approval and it affects my treatment.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds very stressful. It's important for us to address those barriers so you can focus on your recovery.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, but navigating the system feels daunting at times.'

Speaker A: 'Have you been able to find any support services that can assist with these issues?'

Speaker B: 'I've looked into a few, but they seem to provide mixed results. Some help, while others seem to just add more paperwork.'

Speaker A: 'I see. It's vital that we find a service that truly supports you. Letâ€™s explore some options together that might provide the assistance you need.'

Speaker B: 'That would be really helpful. Hopefully, with the right support, managing everything will become a bit easier.'"
