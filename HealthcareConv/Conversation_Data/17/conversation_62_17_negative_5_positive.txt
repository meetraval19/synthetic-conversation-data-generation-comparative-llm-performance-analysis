Speaker B: 'Yes, the obstacles to receiving proper care are frustrating. It's something we need to address urgently.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a brighter note, our new system for patient follow-ups has been receiving great feedback.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear! Patients seem more engaged, and the reminders really help in maintaining continuity of care.'
