"Speaker A: 'We've been seeing some challenges in getting patients the care they need. The barriers are pretty significant.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, with transportation issues and limited access to specialists, itâ€™s tough for many of our patients.'

Speaker C: 'On the neutral side, have we considered revisiting our risk assessment protocols? They might need updating to better identify patient needs upfront.'

Speaker A: 'That's a good point. Adjusting them could streamline our process and reduce some of those access issues.'

Speaker B: 'And when it comes to symptom assessment, do you think incorporating digital tools could be beneficial?'

Speaker C: 'It might help in standardizing evaluations, but we should ensure they don't replace the personal touch our patients value.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, technology should enhance, not replace. We need to find a balance that complements our patient care strategies.'
