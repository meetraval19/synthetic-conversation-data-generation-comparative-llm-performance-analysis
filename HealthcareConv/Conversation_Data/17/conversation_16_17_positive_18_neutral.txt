"Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear you found the new telehealth service helpful for your follow-up.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it made things so much easier without the long drive. Access like this is fantastic!'

Speaker A: 'It’s great to know that these efforts are reducing barriers for patients like you.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, it’s a positive change. Now, I wanted to discuss what I should do in case any symptoms worsen suddenly.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, it’s always good to be prepared. If things change rapidly, visiting the nearest emergency room would be ideal.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. It’s reassuring to have a clear plan for emergencies.' 

Speaker A: 'Yes, keeping things clear helps everyone. Anything else you'd like to discuss?'

Speaker B: 'No, that covers it for today. Thank you!'
