"Speaker A: 'I know we're facing some challenges with coordinating patient care lately. There are significant hurdles that we need to address.'

Speaker B: 'You're right. The administrative processes are definitely a barrier. It's frustrating seeing how it impacts patient outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we need to find a way to streamline these processes to better support our patients.'

Speaker C: 'On another note, have we considered revisiting our symptom assessment protocols? There might be room for improvement.'

Speaker B: 'That's a good point. Our current methods are effective, but it's always worth evaluating them for potential updates.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It's important to ensure our assessments are as accurate as possible, but at least they seem to be holding up well for the most part.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, and perhaps integrating more technology could help, but that's a discussion for another day. Let's focus on making those administrative changes first.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It's crucial we tackle these barriers and optimize our workflow for the sake of our patients' care.'

Speaker A: 'Iâ€™m glad we're on the same page. Let's come up with a plan to address these challenges together.'"
