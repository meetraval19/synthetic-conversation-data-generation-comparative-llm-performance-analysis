"Speaker A: 'During the emergency today, we found innovative ways to overcome some common care barriers.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, deploying the mobile units allowed us to reach patients quickly, which was remarkable.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and the feedback from the community was very encouraging. Addressing these barriers can really make a difference.'

Speaker B: 'However, I felt our attempt at shared decision-making with patients was a bit challenging under pressure.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It seemed difficult to have thorough discussions with patients in such a rushed environment.'

Speaker B: 'We might need to reassess how we approach these conversations in emergency situations to ensure effectiveness.'

Speaker A: 'It's crucial to balance speedy decision-making with the involvement of the patient. Perhaps we need more training in this area.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good plan. Improving this aspect could lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.'"
