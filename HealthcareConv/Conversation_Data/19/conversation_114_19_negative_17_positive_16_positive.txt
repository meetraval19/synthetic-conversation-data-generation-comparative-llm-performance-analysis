Speaker B: 'Yes, the team really helped me connect with community resources. It made a big difference.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. And how did you feel about the way we communicated your diagnosis and treatment options?'

Speaker B: 'I felt really informed and involved. Everything was explained clearly, and it eased my concerns.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad we could provide that clarity. We’ll continue to ensure you have the support you need post-discharge.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I appreciate the efforts, despite the hiccups with support services.'

Speaker A: 'We’re here to address any issues and make your transition home as smooth as possible.'"
