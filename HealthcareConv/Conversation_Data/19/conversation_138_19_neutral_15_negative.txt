"Speaker A: 'Before you leave, let’s talk about the services you might need at home.'

Speaker B: 'Ah, yes. Will there be regular follow-ups for managing my recovery?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We have a neutral stance here to ensure everything is smoothly coordinated. Our team will check in regularly to see how you're doing.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. What about the decision-making process for my treatment?'

Speaker A: 'I understand it wasn’t the easiest. Sometimes the options can be overwhelming, and it felt like the decisions were more about ticking boxes rather than truly considering your preferences.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it did feel like my voice was a bit lost there. Making shared decisions should involve more listening.'

Speaker A: 'We hear you. We’re working on improving that, so your concerns and choices are better reflected in future plans.'"
