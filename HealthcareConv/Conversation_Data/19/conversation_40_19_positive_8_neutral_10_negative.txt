"Speaker A: 'The new support services at the clinic have really improved patient outcomes. I'm seeing a lot more engagement.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the extra resources are making a real difference for our patients.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about Mr. Lane's care plan, do you think it needs updating? It seems pretty stable for now.'

Speaker B: 'I agree; we should keep monitoring but hold off on any major changes until we have more data.'

Speaker A: 'What about therapy adherence? I've noticed a few patients aren't following through with their sessions.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it's concerning. We might need to look into additional interventions to improve adherence.'

Speaker A: 'I think reinforcing the importance of consistency with therapy would be a good start.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's discuss with the team to devise some strategies to tackle this.'"
