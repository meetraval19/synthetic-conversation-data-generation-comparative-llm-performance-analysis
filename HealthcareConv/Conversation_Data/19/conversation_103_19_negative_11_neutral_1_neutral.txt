"Speaker A: 'The support services during the last emergency were really overwhelmed. It was quite frustrating for everyone involved.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It's concerning when we can't manage the calls efficiently.'

Speaker A: 'We definitely need a better system in place for next time. What about the materials we provide patients? Did you get any feedback on those?'

Speaker B: 'It's been a mixed bag. Some patients found the information helpful, while others seemed indifferent.'

Speaker A: 'I think it's important to keep things clear and concise. Not everyone processes information the same way under stress.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. And when it comes to evaluating symptoms, how did you find the team managed it?'

Speaker A: 'I think we did okay, given the circumstances. There were a few hiccups, but overall, it seemed organized.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. It's always challenging when things get hectic, but maintaining consistency is key.'

Speaker A: 'For sure. We should look into streamlining our procedures to improve for next time.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and maybe a review of best practices could help with training everyone effectively.'"
