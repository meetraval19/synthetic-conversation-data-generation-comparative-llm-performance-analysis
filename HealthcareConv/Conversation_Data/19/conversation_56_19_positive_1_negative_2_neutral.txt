"Speaker A: 'We’re excited to let you know about the support services available after your discharge. They’re really top-notch, and our team will guide you every step of the way.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring to hear. I’ve heard that the support teams can be incredibly helpful.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, regarding your symptoms, I understand there have been some concerns that need addressing before you leave.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it’s been frustrating not having a clear understanding of what’s causing some of these issues.'

Speaker A: 'I can imagine. We’ll continue to work closely with you to manage and assess those symptoms. Lastly, your test results are in. They’re pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, that’s good to know, even if it doesn’t answer all our questions.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. The results are neutral, but they’ll be a part of the bigger picture we’ll consider during your follow-up appointments.'
