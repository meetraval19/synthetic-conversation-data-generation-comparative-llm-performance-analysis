"Speaker A: 'I've noticed that our support services seem to be lacking lately. Patients are waiting too long to get the assistance they need.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's frustrating, and it can really impact the patient experience.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, I think we’re doing okay with coordinating referrals. How do you feel about it?'

Speaker B: 'It’s functioning, but there’s always room for improvement. Some processes could be streamlined.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, but when it comes to our team's communication, I’m really impressed. We’ve made great strides in collaborating effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, our meetings have been more productive, and everyone seems well-informed and engaged.' 

Speaker A: 'It's good to see that level of teamwork. It definitely benefits our treatment plans and patient outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'For sure. If we could improve support services with the same energy, it would make a huge difference overall.'"
