"Speaker A: 'During our review of the patient's case, I noticed some gaps in the support services provided. It's rather concerning.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, the coordination between different departments hasn't been as smooth as it should be. It might be causing unnecessary delays for patients.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's crucial we address these inefficiencies. On a brighter note, I think our team communication has been exceptional lately. It's really helping us collaborate better.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! The way we've been working together has improved outcomes significantly. Our morning briefings are particularly effective.'

Speaker A: 'Those seem to foster a real sense of teamwork and timely information exchange.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Now, if we could get the support services to match that level of efficiency, we'd be in a great place.'
