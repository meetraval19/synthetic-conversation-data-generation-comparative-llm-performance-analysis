"Speaker A: 'Considering the treatment plan, have you had any issues with the support services recently?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, yes. It's been quite frustrating dealing with them. The communication isn't great, and it complicates scheduling.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds challenging. On the bright side, I've heard good things about the follow-up procedures. They're supposed to be really thorough.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the follow-up team has been excellent in keeping track and ensuring everything is on course.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. Also, in terms of treatment, I've read that the new protocol might reduce side effects, which is a positive.'

Speaker B: 'I've noticed that too. Patients seem to tolerate it much better than before, which is a great relief for everyone involved.'"
