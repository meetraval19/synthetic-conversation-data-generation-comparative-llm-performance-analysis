"Speaker A: 'Our support services team has really impressed me lately. Their efficiency in handling patient queries is commendable.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! I've received several compliments from patients who feel well-supported and informed.'

Speaker C: 'While it's great to focus on support services, I’m worried about the recent spike in emergency cases we've been handling.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the influx has been challenging. The wait times in the emergency room are longer than we’d like.'

Speaker B: 'True, the stress on our emergency staff is palpable. We need a better strategy to manage this load.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps we could allocate more resources or streamline the triage process to improve response times.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a good point. In the meantime, let's ensure our support teams continue to assist by redirecting non-emergency inquiries away from the ER.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, their role is crucial. Addressing both our support service strengths and emergency challenges will help maintain patient care quality.'

Speaker C: 'Let's prioritize these action points in our next strategic session. Balancing these areas will be key for our team efficiency.'"
