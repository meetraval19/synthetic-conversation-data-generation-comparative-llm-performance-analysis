"Speaker A: 'Our support teams did an incredible job during the response, didn't they?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, their coordination was seamless and it really helped streamline the process.'

Speaker A: 'I was especially impressed with how quickly they set up communication lines for families and staff.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that made a huge difference. However, I am concerned about how incomplete medical records complicated things.'

Speaker A: 'I know, the lack of accurate medical history was a significant challenge. It delayed some critical decisions.'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, it's an issue that seems to persist. We need to address this seriously to improve future outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Although resources for collecting history weren't great, the support services really compensated well in other areas.'

Speaker B: 'They did, and it highlighted just how vital their role is in emergency situations.'

Speaker A: 'Moving forward, improving record-keeping will hopefully enhance the overall response.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, if we can tackle that, and continue to strengthen our support systems, we'll be much better prepared next time.'"
