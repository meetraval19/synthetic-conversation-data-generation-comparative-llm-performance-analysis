Speaker B: 'Honestly, I think the care was fine, but the support services need improvement. I found it hard to get answers when I had questions.'

Speaker A: 'I’m really sorry to hear that. We’re working on improving communication. Have you had a chance to discuss your discharge plan?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I did. Everything seemed straightforward, but I’m still a bit unclear about some of the details.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s review it together. It’s important you feel completely informed before leaving. On another note, do you have any concerns about emergencies after your discharge?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, knowing there’s a 24/7 emergency hotline gives me peace of mind. It’s reassuring to know there’s always someone available if something happens.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. We aim to ensure you have the support you need for a smooth transition home.'"
