"Speaker A: 'The response effort today highlighted how critical team communication is during crises. Our coordination was seamless.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, everyone knew their role, which made everything flow smoothly. It was impressive to see.'

Speaker A: 'However, I'm concerned about how support services lag behind. The delay in equipment delivery was frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, it seems to be a recurring issue. It’s something we must address to improve our overall response time.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the communication among the team is definitely our strong point, but we can't rely on that alone if the resources aren’t there on time.'

Speaker B: 'True, fixing those logistical problems with support services should be a priority in our next debrief.'
