"Speaker A: 'Thanks for coming in for your follow-up. How have you been feeling since the procedure?'

Speaker B: 'I’m doing well, mostly. I did have some questions about the additional support available to me.'

Speaker A: 'Sure, the support services here are designed to assist you as you transition back home. They’re pretty straightforward and flexible.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. Also, I wanted to compliment the team on how well they communicated everything before and after my procedure.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. We really prioritize clear communication to ensure that patients feel supported and informed.'

Speaker B: 'It made a big difference to me, knowing everyone was on the same page. I felt really taken care of.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. We'll continue to keep the communication open and make sure you have everything you need as you recover.'"
