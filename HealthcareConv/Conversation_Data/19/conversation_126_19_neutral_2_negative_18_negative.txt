Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. The inconsistencies could impact our overall findings if not addressed quickly.'  

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We'll need to consult with the analysis team to look into it deeper.'  

Speaker B: 'And regarding the emergency alerts we flagged last week, it's concerning that these issues haven't been resolved yet.'

Speaker B: 'Let's ensure they have all the support they need, focusing on preventing any recurrence in future phases.'  

Speaker A: 'Definitely. We need proactive measures to keep everything on track and maintain the integrity of our study.'
