Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it's been a bit of a nightmare trying to get everything organized. It would be great if it were more streamlined.'

Speaker A: 'I completely understand. Now, I did get a chance to look at your latest test outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, how do they look?'

Speaker A: 'They’re stable, nothing unexpected there. We’re in a good position to continue monitoring.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks for the update, and hopefully the referral process gets better soon!'
