"Speaker A: 'I've been hearing some concerns about how our referral coordination is creating bottlenecks.' 

Speaker B: 'I agree. The inefficiencies in the process are definitely causing delays for patients, which isn't ideal.'

Speaker A: 'We definitely need to address those challenges soon. On a different note, how's the approach towards shared decision making progressing?'

Speaker B: 'It's interesting. The teams seem to be adapting well, and patients are appreciating the collaborative discussions, though there are always nuances in every case.'

Speaker A: 'It's good to see that balance being maintained. What about the documentation review? I assume it's a mixed bag as always?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's mostly routine. There haven't been any major issues, just the usual need for thoroughness to ensure everything aligns with compliance standards.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. Hopefully, we'll streamline the referral issues soon to match the progress in other areas.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Making those improvements will create a much smoother experience for everyone involved.'"
