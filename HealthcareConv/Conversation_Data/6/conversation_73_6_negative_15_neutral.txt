"Speaker A: 'I see you've been trying to get in touch with the specialist I referred you to. Any updates?'

Speaker B: 'It's been a bit frustrating, to be honest. Coordinating between different offices has been more complicated than expected.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, referral systems can sometimes have those hiccups. We'll do our best to streamline the process for you.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. On another note, I've been reading up on the treatment options you suggested last time. I’d like to make sure we’re on the same page about choosing the right path.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's important to make a decision that you’re comfortable with, considering all factors. Let me know if there’s anything you’re unsure about.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I just want to feel informed before moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'That’s completely understandable. Let’s work together to address your concerns and make the best decision for your health.'
