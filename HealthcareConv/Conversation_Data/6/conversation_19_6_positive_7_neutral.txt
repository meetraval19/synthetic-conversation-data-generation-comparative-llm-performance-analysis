"Speaker A: 'Good news! Your discharge is planned for tomorrow, and weâ€™ve coordinated a referral to an excellent physiotherapy clinic.' 

Speaker B: 'Oh, that sounds great, I've heard a lot of good things about that clinic.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, they have a fantastic reputation. It should really help you in your recovery journey.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate the effort. How has the team been managing all these details? Must be a lot to handle, right?'

Speaker B: 'I can imagine, especially with so many different professionals involved.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, but everyone is dedicated to ensuring you receive the best care possible.'"
