"Speaker A: 'I heard that the referral process to the specialist went smoothly. How was your experience with that?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it was fantastic! The coordination was seamless, and I was able to see the specialist really quickly. It was such a relief.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. Now, about the team communication, how did you find the discussions with the different doctors and nurses?'

Speaker B: 'It was okay. Everyone seemed to be on the same page, although sometimes it felt like I had to repeat myself a bit to each new person.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We’re working on making those transitions smoother. How about the therapy sessions? Have you been able to stick to the schedule we talked about?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it's been challenging. I find myself missing sessions because things just get in the way. It's frustrating because I know I need to be consistent to see progress.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. Maybe we can explore some strategies to make it easier for you to adhere to the schedule. Would that help?'

Speaker B: 'I think so. Having a bit more structure might help me stay on track. Thanks for understanding.'"
