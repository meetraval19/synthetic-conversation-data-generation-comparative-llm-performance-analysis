"Speaker A: 'The coordination for transferring patients to specialist departments today was quite chaotic.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. The system seems to have some bottlenecks, especially during peak times.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's concerning. We need a more streamlined process for referrals.'

Speaker B: 'Maybe having dedicated staff could help, but it might not solve everything.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, but it's a start. As for our team, how do you think the communication went today?'

Speaker B: 'I'd say it was decent. Everyone managed to stay on top of things, despite the rush.'

Speaker A: 'True, though there was some room for improvement. A bit more clarity during handovers could help.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. We should look into having more structured debriefs after such busy shifts.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a good plan. It could really enhance how we handle things in the future.'"
