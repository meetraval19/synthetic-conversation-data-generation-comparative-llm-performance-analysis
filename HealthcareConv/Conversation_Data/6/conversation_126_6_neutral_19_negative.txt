"Speaker A: 'So, let's discuss coordinating the referral for your patient to the specialist.'

Speaker B: 'That's a good start. Making sure we have all the documentation in place is crucial.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's key to ensure there are no delays in transitioning their care.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, although I'm concerned about how seamless their integration with support services will be.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Unfortunately, there have been ongoing issues with the availability and efficiency of those services.'

Speaker B: 'I hope that doesn't cause too many complications for the patient.'

Speaker A: 'We'll do our best to communicate and hopefully streamline the process, but it's challenging when the services aren't consistent.'"
