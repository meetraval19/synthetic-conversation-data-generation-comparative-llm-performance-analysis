Speaker B: 'Yes, that makes sense. It's crucial that all the departments are coordinated properly.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, ensuring everything is aligned can certainly streamline your experience. Now, let's talk about the medication you might need.'

Speaker B: 'I'm quite concerned about the potential side effects. I’ve read that some can be pretty severe.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Let's make sure we rectify that moving forward so you feel more comfortable with the treatment plan.'"
