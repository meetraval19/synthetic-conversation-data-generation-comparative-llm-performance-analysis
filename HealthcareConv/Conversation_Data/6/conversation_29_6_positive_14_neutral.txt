"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to see you're ready for discharge today. We've coordinated with a specialist who'll be handling your follow-up care.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. It's good to know everything's lined up for the next steps.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, our referral team has ensured a smooth transition. You'll be in excellent hands.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I'm just a bit concerned about any medication side effects. Is there anything specific I should look out for?'

Speaker A: 'Most patients report mild side effects, like dizziness or fatigue, but nothing too severe. It's important to take note of any changes and let your new doctor know.'

Speaker B: 'I will do that. It helps to know what's typical, so I donâ€™t worry unnecessarily.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, and we're always here to address any concerns you might have. Just remember that your care team is just a call away.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate it, and thanks again for coordinating everything so efficiently.'"
