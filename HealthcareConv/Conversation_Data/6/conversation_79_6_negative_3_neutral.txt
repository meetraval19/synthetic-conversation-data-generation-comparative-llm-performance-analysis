"Speaker A: 'During the recent emergency, I noticed some challenges with coordinating referrals.' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it seemed like there were delays getting patients to the right specialists. It's frustrating when paperwork gets in the way of patient care.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We need a more streamlined process to ensure faster responses in critical situations.'

Speaker B: 'On the medication side of things, how did the review process go for you?'

Speaker A: 'It was relatively smooth, actually. Most of the prescriptions were up to date, thankfully.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. It helps when medication records are organized and accessible.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, having electronic health records plays a big role in simplifying that part of our job.'

Speaker B: 'If only we could apply the same efficiency to referrals. It would make a significant difference.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we should propose a review of our referral processes during the next meeting.'"
