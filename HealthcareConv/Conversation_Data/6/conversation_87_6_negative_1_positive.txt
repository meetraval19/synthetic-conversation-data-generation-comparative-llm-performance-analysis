"Speaker A: 'I wanted to discuss how we've been handling patient symptoms in our assessments lately. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.' 

Speaker B: 'Yes, our new protocols and training sessions have really made a difference. Patients appreciate the thoroughness and care we provide during assessments.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it's great to see that our efforts are paying off in such a significant way. However, I've noticed some issues with how we coordinate referrals.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, it's been a challenge. Patients have expressed frustration about delays and miscommunications with referrals. It seems like there are bottlenecks in the process.'

Speaker A: 'We definitely need to address that. Perhaps we can look into streamlining the referral process or enhancing our communication channels between departments.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good plan. Improving this aspect will surely enhance our overall patient care experience.'"
