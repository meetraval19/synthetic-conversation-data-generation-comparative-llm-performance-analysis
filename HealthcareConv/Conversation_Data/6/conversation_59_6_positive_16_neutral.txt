"Speaker A: 'We've made some great progress in streamlining how patients are referred to specialists. The new system is really efficient.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Patients are getting appointments faster, which helps everyone involved.'

Speaker C: 'That's fantastic to hear. Now, about how we communicate diagnoses to patients and their families. How are things going there?'

Speaker A: 'It's a bit more complex. There's still a lot of discussion around best practices. Some appreciate the detailed information, while others find it overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, the neutrality in reactions is evident. It's clear we need to tailor our approach to individual cases more effectively.'

Speaker C: 'Definitely. Striking a balance between being informative and not overwhelming is key. It seems like a continuous journey of adjustment.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It’s crucial to ensure that our communication is both clear and compassionate, without losing the necessary detail.' 

Speaker B: 'Well, I think as long as we're aware and continuously working on it, we’re on the right track.'"
