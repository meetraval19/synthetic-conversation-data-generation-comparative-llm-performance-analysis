"Speaker A: 'I’ve seen some great improvements in how we're handling patient referrals. It’s become much smoother and more efficient lately.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, the coordination between specialists and primary care has definitely been a bright spot. However, I’m concerned about how we're communicating diagnoses to patients.'

Speaker A: 'Yeah, there’s been feedback that some patients leave confused and anxious about their diagnoses. It’s something we really need to address.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Clear communication is crucial, and it seems to be an area we are struggling with.'

Speaker A: 'On top of that, our initial symptom assessments sometimes fall short. Patients don’t always feel like we’re listening, and important details might get overlooked.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it can affect the whole treatment plan if the initial assessment isn’t thorough. We need to find ways to improve on this front too.'"
