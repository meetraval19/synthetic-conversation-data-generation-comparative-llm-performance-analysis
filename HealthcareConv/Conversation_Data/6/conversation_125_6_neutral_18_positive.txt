"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear you're feeling better and ready for discharge. Let's talk about your follow-up care.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I'm eager to continue my recovery at home. How does the scheduling work for my follow-up appointments?'

Speaker A: 'We'll coordinate your referrals with the specialists you need to see. It’s straightforward, and we’ll handle most of the paperwork for you.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds manageable. I'm just relieved everything is in place.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Also, if you experience any urgent symptoms once you're home, what should you do?'

Speaker B: 'I should contact emergency services or head to the ER if necessary.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It’s important to know that you have support if anything critical arises. How do you feel about handling that?'

Speaker B: 'It’s reassuring to know I have a clear plan. Thanks for making sure everything's set before I go.'"
