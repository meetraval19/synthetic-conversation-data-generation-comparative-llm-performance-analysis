"Speaker A: 'I got your referral to the specialist. The coordination between clinics was really seamless this time.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. We’ve been working on improving that process.'

Speaker A: 'I appreciate it. It definitely makes things easier on my end. But I was a bit confused by the initial test explanations.'

Speaker B: 'I’m sorry to hear that. We’re aware that sometimes the way we communicate diagnoses can be unclear.'

Speaker A: 'It’s not a big deal, but it did leave me a bit worried initially.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. We’re trying to improve how we convey such important information, so receiving feedback really helps.'

Speaker A: 'Thanks for being responsive to feedback. It makes the whole experience a lot more positive overall.'"
