"Speaker A: 'I understand you're ready for discharge. Before you leave, let's ensure everything is set for you.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I'm eager to go home but concerned about how smoothly the handover to the outpatient team will go. It feels like the coordination isn't always seamless.'

Speaker A: 'I hear you. We sometimes face challenges with that, but we're committed to keeping the process as smooth as possible despite the hiccups.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, I guess I'll have to keep following up. Can you tell me more about what I should be doing at home?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely! We've put together a comprehensive guide for you. It covers everything you need to know, step by step. I think you'll find it very empowering.'

Speaker B: 'Great! That sounds helpful. And what about the instructions from the doctor?'

Speaker A: 'The treatment plan is pretty straightforward. You'll continue the medication as prescribed and attend follow-up appointments.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, that sounds manageable. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right.'

Speaker A: 'You're in good shape. With the education materials and support, youâ€™ll do just fine. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.'
