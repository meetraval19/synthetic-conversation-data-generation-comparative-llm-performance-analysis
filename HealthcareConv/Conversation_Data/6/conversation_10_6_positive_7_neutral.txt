"Speaker A: 'I must say, the referral process during the emergency went smoothly thanks to our coordination with specialists.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The way the team managed to get the right specialists involved was impressive.'

Speaker A: 'I think streamlining our procedures has really paid off. Everyone knew exactly who to contact and when.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, that's a good point. On another note, how did you feel about the team's communication overall during the incident?'

Speaker A: 'I'd say it was adequate. Information flowed, but there were moments where it seemed a bit fragmented.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. There were times when messages got lost in the shuffle. But overall, it seemed under control.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we should focus on smoothing out those gaps in future drills to prevent any delays.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Refining that aspect could improve our response time even further. But I'm really glad about how well we coordinated referrals.'"
