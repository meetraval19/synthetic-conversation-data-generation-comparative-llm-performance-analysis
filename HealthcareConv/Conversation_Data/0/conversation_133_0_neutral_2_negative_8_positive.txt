Speaker B: 'Absolutely. However, on a brighter note, the updated care plan shows promising improvements. The new medication protocol could make a significant difference.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, and the inclusion of physical therapy might enhance recovery times. It's encouraging to see such potential.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. While the results were a setback, having a strong care plan can boost the patient's journey forward.'"
