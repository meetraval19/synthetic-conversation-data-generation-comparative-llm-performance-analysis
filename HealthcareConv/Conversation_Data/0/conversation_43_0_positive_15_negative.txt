"Speaker A: 'Your work with patients' medical histories has been outstanding. You've really helped streamline the process for the team.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you! It's been rewarding to see the improvements in how we manage and access that information.'

Speaker A: 'However, there have been some concerns raised about the shared decision-making approach with patients. It seems there are some gaps.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. I’m exploring ways to enhance communication and ensure patients are more informed and engaged in the decision process.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a positive step forward. Let’s discuss how we can support you in these efforts to improve outcomes.'
