"Speaker A: 'The situation was more challenging than expected, largely due to incomplete records.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, those missing details really delayed critical decision-making.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It's frustrating when we don't have comprehensive medical backgrounds at our fingertips.'

Speaker B: 'On a neutral note, the way we managed to liaise with different specialists for a coordinated response was quite smooth.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Despite the initial hurdles, our referral coordination has definitely become more efficient over time.'

Speaker B: 'It's good to know our system can handle that aspect without added stress. We just need to focus on improving other areas.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, enhancing the way we gather full medical histories has to be a priority moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'Right. If we address that, our responses will be much more streamlined all around.'"
