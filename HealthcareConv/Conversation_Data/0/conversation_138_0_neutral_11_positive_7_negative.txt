"Speaker A: 'Before we finalize your discharge, let's review your medical history to ensure everything is in order.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I've been keeping track. I'm just glad to finally be going home.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, but it's important to go over it once more. That way, we address any patterns or concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Makes sense. What about understanding my medications and follow-up care?'

Speaker A: 'Great question! We have some resources and educational materials that will be really beneficial for you. Understanding your treatment is vital for your recovery.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It sounds encouraging to have that kind of support.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Now, regarding the treatments, I wish there was better team communication. It sometimes causes unnecessary delays.'

Speaker B: 'I did notice the same issue. It seemed like not everyone was always on the same page.'

Speaker A: 'We're working on improving that. Your feedback helps us identify where changes can be made.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad it's being addressed. Hopefully, it’ll be smoother for future patients.'

Speaker A: 'That’s the goal. Your health journey matters to us, and we're here to ensure you have everything you need before heading home.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks for taking the time to explain all this. I feel more confident about leaving now.'"
