"Speaker A: 'Our first agenda item is the medication review. We've had some feedback about potential issues with dosage instructions.'  
Speaker B: 'Yes, some patients reported confusion, leading to non-compliance. It's quite concerning.'  
Speaker C: 'We definitely need to address this urgently. Perhaps we can streamline the instructions further.'  

Speaker A: 'Moving on, let's talk about support services. How are they being perceived?'  
Speaker B: 'From what Iâ€™ve gathered, the feedback is mixed. Some find them helpful, while others are indifferent.'  
Speaker C: 'It might be valuable to evaluate how we're promoting these services and increase awareness.'  

Speaker A: 'Lastly, we should discuss patient education. Are the educational materials effectively reaching everyone?'  
Speaker B: 'It's a bit of a mixed bag. Some patients appreciate the information, but others seem uninterested.'  
Speaker C: 'Maybe we can look at different formats to cater to various preferences and improve engagement.'  

Speaker A: 'Good points. Let's work on these areas and reconvene next week with updates on our progress.'"
