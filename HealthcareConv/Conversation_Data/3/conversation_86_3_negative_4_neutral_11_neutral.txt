Speaker B: 'Yes, I've noticed that too. Perhaps it's time to reassess the treatment plan overall. It's been a while since our last review.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, but we should approach it carefully. Maybe focus on adjusting dosages or considering alternatives without making drastic changes.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Clear communication and setting realistic expectations can really empower patients in managing their health.'
