"Speaker A: 'I see you're here for a medication review today, how have things been going with your current prescriptions?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, really well. I'm feeling more energetic and the side effects have been minimal.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear! Adjusting the dosage last month seems to have worked well then.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, I really appreciate the changes you've made.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, are you ready to discuss the upcoming discharge plan?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I'm a bit concerned about it. The last time, the instructions were overwhelming and I felt a bit lost after leaving.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We'll ensure everything is clear this time and also set up follow-up visits to ease the transition.'

Speaker B: 'That would be really helpful. I just don't want to feel like I'm on my own after I'm discharged.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, and Iâ€™ll make sure you have all the necessary support and contacts you need.'"
