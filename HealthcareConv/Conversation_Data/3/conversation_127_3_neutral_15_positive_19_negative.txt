"Speaker A: 'Let's start by discussing the patient's medication. There haven't been any recent changes, right?'

Speaker B: 'That's correct. The current treatment seems stable for now.'

Speaker A: 'Great. Now, about our approach to involving the patient in their care, I think our meeting with them went well.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. They appreciated being included in decisions about their treatment plan.'

Speaker A: 'It's always rewarding when patients feel empowered in their care journey.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. However, one concern I have is the lack of available support services.'

Speaker A: 'I know. It's frustrating that support services are limited, and it affects patient outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, this can be quite challenging for both the patients and us as providers.'

Speaker A: 'We should look into alternative ways to offer support until more resources become available.'
