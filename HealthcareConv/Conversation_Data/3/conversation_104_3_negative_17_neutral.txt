"Speaker A: 'So, how have you been feeling since your last appointment?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I'm a bit concerned about the new medication. I've been experiencing some side effects.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the side effects you've been experiencing?'

Speaker B: 'I've had a lot of fatigue, and it's been difficult to concentrate.'

Speaker A: 'That doesn't sound ideal. We'll need to review your current prescription and see if an adjustment or alternative is necessary.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It's been frustrating trying to manage these side effects.'

Speaker A: 'I can understand. Let's make it a priority to address this.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I've also encountered some issues with access to care. Scheduling appointments has been challenging.'

Speaker A: 'That's unfortunately common. Sometimes, the system can be a bit daunting.' 

Speaker B: 'Yes, it feels like jumping through hoops just to get things set up.'

Speaker A: 'Let's see if we can streamline things for you, perhaps by arranging follow-ups electronically or coordinating with your pharmacy.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. It would certainly simplify things.' 

Speaker A: 'Great, let's work on that. Anything else that's been on your mind?'

Speaker B: 'No, that covers the main concerns.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, we'll tackle these issues together. I'm here to help you feel your best.'"
