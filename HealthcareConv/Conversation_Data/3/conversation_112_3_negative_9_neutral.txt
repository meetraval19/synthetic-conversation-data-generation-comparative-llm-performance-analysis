Speaker B: 'I'd appreciate that. It would be great to find something that doesn’t disrupt my daily routine as much.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We’ll explore other options. Now, let's move on to the assessment we planned.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I’m curious to know about any potential concerns.'

Speaker A: 'The results are fairly standard, nothing alarming. It's all about maintaining current habits and staying on top of check-ups.'

Speaker B: 'Good to hear. I'll do my best to keep up with everything.'

Speaker A: 'That's great. Consistency is key. And I’ll support you through the process as we adjust your treatment plan.'
