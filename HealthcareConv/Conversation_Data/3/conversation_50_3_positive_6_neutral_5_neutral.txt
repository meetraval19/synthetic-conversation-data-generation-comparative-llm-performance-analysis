"Speaker A: 'Our recent medication review has shown promising results. The efficacy of the new treatment is truly impressive.'

Speaker B: 'That's fantastic! Improved patient outcomes are always great to hear. Now, about coordinating referrals, how should we proceed?'

Speaker C: 'Referral processes have been stable, but there's room for streamlining. Standardizing the procedure could improve efficiency.'
