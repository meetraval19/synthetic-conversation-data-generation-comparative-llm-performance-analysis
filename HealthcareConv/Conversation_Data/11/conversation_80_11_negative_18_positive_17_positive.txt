"Speaker A: 'Before you leave, I want to make sure you understand all the instructions. It seems like patients often leave without a clear understanding of their care plan.'

Speaker B: 'I've heard that too, but this time, I've got a comprehensive summary. It should help clear up any confusion.'

Speaker A: 'Great! Now, if there are any emergencies or sudden issues, you have the direct numbers to contact us immediately. Our emergency response team is highly efficient.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. It’s good to know someone is always ready to help when needed.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Also, regarding access to follow-up care, we're improving support in that area too. We've removed some of the previous hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Better accessibility makes a huge difference during recovery.'"
