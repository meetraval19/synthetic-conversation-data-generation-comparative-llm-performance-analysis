"Speaker A: 'I know it's not always easy to keep up with all the information I provide about your condition.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the sheer amount of information can be quite overwhelming at times. I get mixed up easily.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Let's see if we can streamline some of the important points today.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. I appreciate it.'

Speaker A: 'Now, regarding your symptoms, can you tell me more about any recent changes?’

Speaker B: 'Honestly, nothing major has changed. It’s pretty much the same as before.'

Speaker A: 'Okay, maintaining consistency is often a good sign, but we’ll keep monitoring it closely.'

Speaker B: 'Makes sense. What about seeing that specialist you mentioned last time?'

Speaker A: 'Right, the referral process can sometimes involve a bit of back and forth. We're coordinating with their office, just waiting for their confirmation.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, I'll wait to hear back. Should I call them, or will you let me know once it's set?'

Speaker A: 'We'll notify you as soon as we have that appointment confirmed. It shouldn’t take too long.’

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring. Thank you for clarifying everything today.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, I'm here to help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions later on.'

Speaker B: 'I will, thanks for being so patient with me.'"
