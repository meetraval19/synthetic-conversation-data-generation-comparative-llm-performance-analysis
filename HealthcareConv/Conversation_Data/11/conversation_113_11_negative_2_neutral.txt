"Speaker A: 'So, it looks like you’re all set to go home. Do you have any questions about the care instructions?'

Speaker B: 'Well, I’m a bit concerned about how unclear some of the instructions seem. It's confusing.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It can feel overwhelming. Let’s go over them step-by-step to make sure you feel confident.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. I want to avoid any mistakes once I’m home.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Also, regarding your recent tests, they didn’t show anything unexpected.'

Speaker B: 'Right, I remember you mentioning that. So, no surprises there?'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Everything remains stable, which is reassuring. But I know the terms can be technical, so feel free to ask anything.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I might need more clarity on a few points. I appreciate your patience.'"
