"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to see you're ready for discharge. We've prepared some helpful resources for you to continue your recovery at home.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! I appreciate all the information. Understanding my treatment plan really puts my mind at ease.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's important you feel comfortable with the next steps. Let's discuss your follow-up appointments.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, I just want to make sure I don't miss anything. Are there specific things I need to bring to these sessions?'

Speaker A: 'Just your current medications and any questions you might have about your recovery. The follow-ups are routine and help us ensure you're healing well.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds straightforward. What about the test results? Should I be concerned about them?'

Speaker A: 'Your test results came back within normal ranges. Nothing alarming, but itâ€™s always good to monitor and discuss them further during your next visit.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief. Thanks for clarifying. I feel more prepared to manage things at home now. The support has been wonderful.'
