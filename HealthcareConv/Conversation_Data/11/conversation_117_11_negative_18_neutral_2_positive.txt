"Speaker A: 'It looks like your test results are very encouraging. Everything is in great shape.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief to hear. What about going home, though? How will I manage everything?'

Speaker A: 'You'll have everything you need before you leave. But we understand that sometimes the instructions can feel overwhelming.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. I remember last time I didn’t really understand the paperwork. It felt like too much information.'

Speaker A: 'We’re working on simplifying the discharge process. Your health is our priority, and we want you to feel confident and supported.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Just in case something unexpected happens, like severe pain or a high fever, what should I do?'

Speaker A: 'That's a good question. We’ll provide you with a list of symptoms to watch out for, and you can reach us anytime. But most importantly, listen to your body and don’t hesitate to come back if needed.'

Speaker B: 'Alright. Thank you for being thorough with the explanation. I wish the other stuff felt as clear.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, and I’m here to ensure you feel comfortable. The more we can improve our communication, the better the transition home will be for you.'"
