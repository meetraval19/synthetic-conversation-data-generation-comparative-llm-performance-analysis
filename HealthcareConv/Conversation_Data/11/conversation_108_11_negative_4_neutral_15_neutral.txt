"Speaker A: 'Before you leave, let’s go over your treatment plan. It’s important to ensure you’re clear about the next steps.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, what do I need to know about managing my medications at home?'

Speaker A: 'The doctors have detailed the medications and the schedule. It’s pretty standard and should be manageable.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, but I'm a bit worried. The last time, there wasn’t much instruction on what to do if I missed a dose.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concern. There is some room for improvement in how we provide patient education upon discharge.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. Now, about making decisions together, I'm curious how involved I can be in adjusting my treatment moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'You can discuss any adjustments during follow-up appointments. It’s a partnership, and your input is valuable in shared decisions.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Being involved helps me stay more committed to my recovery.'"
