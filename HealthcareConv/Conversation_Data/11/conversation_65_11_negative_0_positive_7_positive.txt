"Speaker A: 'How have you been feeling since we last met?'

Speaker B: 'I’ve been okay, but I’m still a bit confused about some of the instructions I received last time.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. We can review everything today to ensure it's clearer for you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. On the plus side, I looked over my old records, and sharing those really helped us make progress with my treatment, didn't it?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Your comprehensive history has been instrumental in guiding our approach.'

Speaker B: 'I also appreciate how everyone in your office communicates. It makes me feel more confident in the care I’m receiving.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. We strive to ensure you’re supported by the entire team.'
