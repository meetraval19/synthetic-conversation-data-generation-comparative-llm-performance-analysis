"Speaker A: 'Before you leave, let's go over some important instructions to make sure you're comfortable with your care plan.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, that sounds good. I was a bit overwhelmed with all the information earlier.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It's a lot to take in. We can review everything step by step to make sure you feel confident.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I appreciate that. I just wish the initial explanation of my diagnosis had been clearer. It was a bit confusing.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. Sometimes those conversations can be complicated, but I’m here to clarify any questions you might have now.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Knowing what to expect really helps.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We’ll make sure to address all your concerns before discharge, and you’ll have printed materials to take home as well.'

Speaker B: 'Great, having something to refer back to will be really helpful. Thank you for taking the time to guide me through this.'"
