"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our patient education materials, and it seems they're not as effective as we hoped.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Patients often express confusion after discharge.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We might need to simplify the language or use more visuals.'

Speaker B: 'That could help. On a brighter note, our follow-up system has shown great improvement.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the new automated reminders have increased patient engagement significantly.'

Speaker B: 'And patients appreciate the personalized follow-up calls. It seems to really make a difference.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It helps build trust and ensures they're on the right path.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Let's try to bring that same success to our educational efforts.'"
