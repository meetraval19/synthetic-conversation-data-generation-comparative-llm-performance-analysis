Speaker B: 'I agree. Sometimes patients get overwhelmed and miss key information.'

Speaker A: 'Right, but on a brighter note, our patients have been really consistent with following their therapy plans lately.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, that's been encouraging. It shows they're committed to their health.'

Speaker B: 'Seems like a practical approach. Let’s keep refining it for better results.'"
