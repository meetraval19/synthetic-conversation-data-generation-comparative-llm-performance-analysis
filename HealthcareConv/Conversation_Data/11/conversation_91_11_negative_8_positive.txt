Speaker A: 'That's great to hear! Anything specific that stands out?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, we've incorporated more collaborative approaches, and patients seem more engaged in their treatment.'

Speaker A: 'Thatâ€™s a positive change. Greater involvement can make a big difference in patient satisfaction and health.'
