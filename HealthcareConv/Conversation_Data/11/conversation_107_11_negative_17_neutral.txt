"Speaker A: 'Thank you for visiting us, and we’re preparing your discharge. How do you feel about the information provided for your aftercare?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed. The instructions were pretty confusing.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We’ve been working on making the materials clearer, but it seems like there’s still room for improvement.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It's crucial to grasp everything, especially with the medication and lifestyle changes.'

Speaker A: 'We'll make sure a nurse explains everything again, and we’ll provide a direct contact number for any questions you might have from home.'

Speaker B: 'That would definitely help. What about accessing follow-up care?'

Speaker A: 'Well, transportation and scheduling can be a hassle for some patients. We aim to make those processes smoother, but it can be challenging.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I guess it’s not entirely avoidable. I’ll try to work it out from my end as well.'

Speaker A: 'Feel free to reach out if you face any hurdles. We want to make this transition as easy as possible for you.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I appreciate the support and hope things go smoothly after this.'"
