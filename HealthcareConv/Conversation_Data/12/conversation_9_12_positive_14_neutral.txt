"Speaker A: 'I’ve finished reviewing your discharge papers, and everything looks well-documented. You’re all set to go home today.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a relief to hear! It’s great to know how well-organized everything is.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we make sure everything is clear for a smooth transition home. Now, about your medication, some might have minor effects you should be aware of.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, I see. Could you give me a bit more information on what to expect?'

Speaker A: 'Certainly, some patients experience mild dizziness or upset stomach at first, but it often subsides quickly.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds manageable, as long as it doesn’t interfere too much with my activities.'

Speaker A: 'If you notice anything unusual or if the symptoms persist, be sure to give us a call. Your care doesn’t stop just because you’re leaving the hospital.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It’s reassuring to know I’m still supported after discharge.'"
