"Speaker A: 'Alright, let's go over your discharge paperwork. Everything looks in order.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. Is there anything specific I should pay attention to?'

Speaker A: 'Just the usual instructions and follow-up appointments. It's all straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Great, I’m glad there aren’t any surprises there. However, I’m a bit concerned about the support I’ll have at home.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It can be challenging if there are obstacles to accessing care.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. I'm worried that limited transportation might make getting to appointments tough.'

Speaker A: 'We have a social worker who can help explore options, perhaps scheduling transport services.'

Speaker B: 'That would be really helpful. I appreciate that you're addressing these issues.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Our goal is to ensure you have everything you need when you leave here.'"
