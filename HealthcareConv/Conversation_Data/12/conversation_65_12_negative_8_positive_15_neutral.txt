"Speaker A: 'I just finished reviewing the latest documentation, and it's so overwhelming. There's always inconsistency in the records.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It's frustrating when the notes aren't clear, but let's focus on the care plan update. I think the new approach could really enhance patient outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely! The idea of integrating more holistic therapies is very promising. Patients could really benefit from this change.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it seems like the team is on board too. How are we approaching shared decisions with the families?'

Speaker A: 'It's a bit challenging, as each family has different concerns. But maintaining open communication should help us manage their expectations effectively.'
