"Speaker A: 'I think our approach to discussing diagnoses with patients has improved significantly. The feedback has been quite positive lately.'

Speaker B: 'I completely agree. Patients seem to appreciate the clarity and transparency.'

Speaker C: 'That's great to hear. Now, regarding the process of coordinating referrals, does everyone feel it's working smoothly?'

Speaker A: 'Well, itâ€™s functioning, but there always seems to be room for more streamlined processes. What do you think?'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it's not exactly seamless yet. We could definitely enhance communication between departments to speed things up.'

Speaker C: 'Indeed. Maybe we should look into more integrated systems to ensure everything is aligned and efficient.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a good plan. Let's focus on leveraging our existing resources to make the process easier for everyone involved.'"
