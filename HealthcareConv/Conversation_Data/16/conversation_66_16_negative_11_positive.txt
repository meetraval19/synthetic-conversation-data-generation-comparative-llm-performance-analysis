"Speaker A: 'Hi, Doctor. I’ve been feeling a bit uneasy after our last discussion.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It can be overwhelming when you first hear about a condition. Let’s go over everything again to clear things up.'

Speaker A: 'I appreciate that. I just felt the explanation was too brief, and it left me worried.'

Speaker B: 'I'm sorry to hear that. It’s crucial you feel informed. Let's take our time to go through each aspect of the diagnosis.'

Speaker A: 'Thank you. Knowing there are tools and support available is reassuring.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. Understanding your health is empowering. Let’s ensure you leave feeling confident about the next steps.'

Speaker A: 'I already feel better knowing I have your support.’
