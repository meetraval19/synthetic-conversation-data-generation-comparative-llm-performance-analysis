"Speaker A: 'I went through the test results and Iâ€™m a bit concerned about how it was explained to me.'  
Speaker B: 'I understand. Sometimes the medical jargon can be overwhelming. How can I clarify things for you?'  

Speaker A: 'That would be helpful. I just need to understand what's going on. On a brighter note, I did notice how quickly the staff responded when I had that issue last week.'  
Speaker B: 'Yes, the emergency response team here is exceptional and always ready to assist swiftly.'  

Speaker A: 'It was reassuring to see them in action. But, returning to the initial findings, could you break it down for me?'  
Speaker B: 'Of course, let me explain it in simpler terms so everything is clear to you.'  

Speaker A: 'Thank you, I appreciate your patience.'  
Speaker B: 'It's my pleasure. Please feel free to ask any questions at any time.'"
