"Speaker A: 'Let's discuss your discharge process. How do you feel about how we communicated your diagnosis?'

Speaker B: 'It was quite straightforward and clear, which was appreciated. I didn’t feel overwhelmed.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. Now, we'll review the care instructions. They can sometimes be confusing, so please feel free to ask questions.'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, there was a lot of information, and I'm worried I might not remember everything.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, and we're here to help make it manageable. We'll go over the key points again and provide written materials.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. Sometimes, it feels like there's too much to absorb at once.'

Speaker A: 'Rest assured, our team is dedicated to supporting you through this. We've had great collaboration to ensure you receive comprehensive care.'

Speaker B: 'I've noticed. The nurses and doctors have been very attentive and seemed to communicate well with each other.'

Speaker A: 'I'm pleased to hear that. We strive to maintain strong team communication to provide the best care possible.'

Speaker B: 'It definitely made me feel more confident about my care.'

Speaker A: 'That’s our goal. We’ll walk you through the next steps to make sure you’re comfortable and prepared for your recovery at home.'"
