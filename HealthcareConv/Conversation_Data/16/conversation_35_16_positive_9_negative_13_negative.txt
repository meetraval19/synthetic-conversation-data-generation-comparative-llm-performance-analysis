Speaker B: 'That's a relief to hear. It's always stressful waiting for those kinds of updates.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It's always best to communicate clearly about what's going on. Now, about the potential risks, I do need to mention some concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Concerns? That sounds worrisome...'

Speaker A: 'It's important to be upfront. While everything looks good for now, there are certain factors we will keep monitoring closely to ensure your ongoing health.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate you being honest. Better to be aware than caught off guard.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Lastly, let's discuss your discharge plan. I wish it could be more straightforward, but we have a bit of coordination to do.'

Speaker B: 'It sounds complicated. What makes it so difficult?'

Speaker A: 'It's mostly about making sure you have the right support and follow-up in place. It's essential to avoid any potential setbacks after you leave.'

Speaker B: 'I hope everything falls into place smoothly. It's a lot to process, but I'm ready to do what's necessary.'"
