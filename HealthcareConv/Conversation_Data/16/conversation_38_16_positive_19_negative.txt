"Speaker A: 'I’m really pleased with how our team has improved communication with patients regarding their diagnoses. It's been beneficial for everyone involved.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Patients seem more at ease when they understand what's happening with their health.'

Speaker C: 'True, but while we’re doing well with diagnoses, I'm concerned about the current state of our support services. Resources are stretched thin, and it's affecting patient care.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a valid point. We’ve had some feedback about the long waiting times for support services. It’s something we need to address.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. If we don’t enhance our support systems, the positive impacts we’ve made in other areas might be overshadowed.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, exactly. We should consider exploring new partnerships or reallocating resources to fill these gaps.'"
