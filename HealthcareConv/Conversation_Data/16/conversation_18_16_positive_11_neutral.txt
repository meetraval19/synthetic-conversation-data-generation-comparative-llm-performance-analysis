"Speaker A: 'I'm really proud of how we’ve improved sharing diagnoses with patients. The clarity in our communication seems to be making a real difference.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, I’ve noticed that patients leave with a clearer understanding and less anxiety.'

Speaker C: 'It’s great to see, but shouldn’t we also look at how we’re educating patients post-diagnosis? There’s still room for growth there.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. While we've streamlined the diagnosis part, patient education needs a consistent approach to be fully effective.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Patients often have more questions after they digest the initial information. Our follow-up has to be thorough.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps, we could introduce more visual aids or digital tools to support this. It might make the information more accessible.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a practical approach. I'll gather some resources we can review at our next meeting.'
