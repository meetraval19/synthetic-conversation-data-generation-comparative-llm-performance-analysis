"Speaker A: 'I reviewed the diagnosis with the patient today, and it went smoothly. They seemed reassured.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Effective communication really makes a difference in understanding their health situation.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It helps them feel more in control and less anxious.'

Speaker B: 'However, Iâ€™m concerned about the limited availability of support services. It seems to create unnecessary stress for the patients.'

Speaker A: 'I know what you mean. The wait times for follow-up services can be frustrating. We really need more resources.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Despite our best efforts, patients are struggling to get the timely support they need.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We should discuss this in our next team meeting and see if there are any interim solutions we can offer the patients.'"
