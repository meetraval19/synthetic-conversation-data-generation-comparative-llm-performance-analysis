"Speaker A: 'During the response, I noticed there was some confusion about communicating the initial findings.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the way the initial diagnosis was relayed created a lot of stress among the team and the patient's family.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We need clear and concise methods for communicating diagnosis to avoid misunderstandings.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. But on a positive note, our team's internal communication during the emergency was remarkable.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Everyone was so coordinated and supportive; it really helped streamline our efforts.'

Speaker B: 'It’s essential we maintain that level of team synergy and perhaps extend it to how we handle diagnosis discussions.'

Speaker A: 'We should consider implementing some training focused on communication skills to bridge these gaps.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a great solution. It would certainly enhance both patient interaction and team efficiency.'"
