Speaker B: 'Yes, I've seen that too. Patients often leave more confused, which is frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a brighter note, our new patient education program has received great feedback.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's empowering to see patients feel more in control of their health with the resources we're providing.'

Speaker C: 'It's crucial they understand their treatments and lifestyle changes for better outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'For sure. Balancing informative content without overwhelming them is key.'
