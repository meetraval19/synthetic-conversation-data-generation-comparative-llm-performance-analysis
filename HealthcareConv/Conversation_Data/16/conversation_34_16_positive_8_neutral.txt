"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to say the clarity in your diagnosis really helped us understand your condition better.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. It was reassuring to have everything explained so clearly. What about my ongoing treatment plan?'

Speaker A: 'The care team has reviewed your plan, and while there aren't any major changes, we'll ensure you have all the support necessary at home.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. It's good to know there's a solid framework in place, even if it remains the same for now.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and we'll continue to monitor your progress closely. Do let us know if anything feels off after discharge.'

Speaker B: 'Of course, I'll make sure to reach out if needed. Thank you for everything.'"
