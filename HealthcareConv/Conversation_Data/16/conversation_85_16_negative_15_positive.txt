"Speaker A: 'Today’s emergency response highlighted some issues with how we communicated the patient’s diagnosis to their family.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it seemed like there was a lot of confusion and distress caused by the way the information was conveyed. We need to find a better approach.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Maybe more training on sensitivity and clarity would help improve those interactions.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, the teamwork in decision-making for the treatment plan was excellent.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Having everyone contribute ensured we made well-rounded decisions for the patient’s care.'

Speaker B: 'It really shows how effective shared decision-making can be. Everyone felt involved and it benefited the patient greatly.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, that collaborative approach is something we should emphasize in future responses.'"
