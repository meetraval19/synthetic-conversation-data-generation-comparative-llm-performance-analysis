"Speaker A: 'I received the results from the tests we did last week.'

Speaker B: 'I'm a bit worried about what they might reveal.'

Speaker A: 'I understand this is concerning. The results weren't as positive as we'd hoped. We'll need to discuss the next steps carefully.'

Speaker B: 'That doesn't sound great. What's the plan moving forward?'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on scheduling regular check-ins. It's important we monitor your progress closely.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, that makes sense. Can you tell me more about how to manage things on my own?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. I'll provide you with resources and guidance for managing your condition day-to-day.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, that sounds helpful. I just want to make sure Iâ€™m doing everything right.'

Speaker A: 'We'll take it step by step, and I'm here to support you with any questions you have.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Knowing more about it definitely makes me feel a bit more at ease.'"
