"Speaker A: 'I'm really glad we were able to communicate the diagnosis clearly. It seemed to give you some peace of mind.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, understanding what was going on made a big difference. I appreciate how everything was explained step by step.'

Speaker A: 'Great to hear. Now, about your discharge plan, we have outlined some steps for a smooth transition home. Are there any questions you have about it?'

Speaker B: 'I think it’s straightforward. I’ll follow the instructions, but I do want to ensure I’m doing everything right.'

Speaker A: 'That’s understandable. We will also provide you with a contact number if you have any issues or need advice after you leave.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect. I also wanted to discuss what I should do if something unexpected happens, like a sudden change in my condition.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. In case of any emergency, you should immediately reach out to the local emergency services and also inform us as soon as possible.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks for clarifying. It’s a relief to know there’s a clear plan in place for emergencies.'

Speaker A: 'We’re here to support you through this process. Do reach out if you have more questions once you're home.'

Speaker B: 'I will. Thank you for your help and care throughout my stay.'"
