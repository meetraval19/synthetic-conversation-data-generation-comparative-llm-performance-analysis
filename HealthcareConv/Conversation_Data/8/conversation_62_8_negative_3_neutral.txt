Speaker B: 'I know, the updates seem to be causing some confusion. We need to clarify the protocols before the next shift.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. On a different note, how did the medication review go yesterday?'

Speaker B: 'The review was smooth. No significant changes needed, so there's some stability there.'

Speaker A: 'That's reassuring. At least we can focus on improving communication around the care plans.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, tackling the update issues should be our priority now to prevent further complications.'"
