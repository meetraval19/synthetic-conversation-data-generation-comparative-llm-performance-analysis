Speaker B: 'It's pretty straightforward, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit for me. Can we explore other options?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we can look into alternative approaches. However, it’s critical to ensure that any changes align with your health needs.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, I just wish I had more clarity. It's hard to weigh everything properly.'
