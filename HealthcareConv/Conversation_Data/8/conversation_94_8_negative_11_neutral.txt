Speaker B: 'Well, I've been following the plan you gave me, but I'm concerned. It seems like it's not as effective as we hoped.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concern. Sometimes adjustments are necessary. Let’s review your progress and discuss tweaking the plan for better results.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right.'
