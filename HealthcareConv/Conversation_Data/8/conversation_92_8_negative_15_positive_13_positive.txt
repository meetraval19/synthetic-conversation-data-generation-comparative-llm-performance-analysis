"Speaker A: 'Hi, I wanted to discuss some concerns I have about the recent changes to my care plan.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. I understand it can be frustrating when plans change, but let's go through it together.'

Speaker A: 'I appreciate that. I’m worried it's not addressing everything we talked about initially.'

Speaker B: 'I see how that might be concerning. Let’s work on creating a shared decision-making approach. Have you considered any adjustments that could improve your comfort with the plan?'

Speaker A: 'I’d feel more confident if we included regular check-ins. It’s reassuring to know my input is valued in these decisions.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, your perspective is crucial. Making sure we agree on the approach will help us both.'

Speaker A: 'Thanks for understanding. Another thing I've been thinking about is the discharge plan. How’s that looking?'

Speaker B: 'Great question. We’re focusing on a smooth transition for you, making sure all support systems are in place. We aim to make it a positive aspect of your recovery.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds promising. I’m relieved to know there’s a clear path forward once I leave here.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let’s continue to work together to ensure you're fully prepared and comfortable with everything before discharge.'

Speaker A: 'This makes me feel much more at ease. Thank you for being so thorough.'

Speaker B: 'You’re welcome. Your health and peace of mind are our top priorities.'"
