"Speaker A: 'I'm glad we're at the point where we can discuss going home. How do you feel about the diagnosis communication you received?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I felt really positive about it. The doctor was clear and helped me understand everything without feeling overwhelmed.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear! Understanding the diagnosis is crucial. Have you had a chance to look over the care plan update?'

Speaker B: 'I did, but I'm a bit concerned. Some changes weren't explained, and it feels a bit confusing.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. The update should havebeen clearer. Let me help clarify any points you’re uncertain about.' 

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. I just want to make sure I'm following everything correctly once I'm home.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. It’s important you feel confident about the plan. We’ll go through it together and make sure all your questions are answered.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. That would really put my mind at ease.'

Speaker A: 'You're welcome. Let’s make sure you leave with everything you need to feel comfortable and supported.'
