"Speaker A: 'So, let's go over the updates to your care plan before you're discharged.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I wasn’t expecting anything major to change with it.'

Speaker A: 'That's right; it's mostly routine checks. Just ensuring everything is in place for a smooth transition home.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds straightforward enough. What about the follow-up appointments? I’ve heard it can be tricky to schedule those.'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, it can be a bit of a hassle. The scheduling system is still being improved, and some patients report delays.'

Speaker B: 'That’s frustrating. I just don’t want to fall through the cracks.'

Speaker A: 'Completely understandable. I'll make sure to put a note for the team to prioritize your follow-up, so we minimize any inconvenience.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I really appreciate that. Hopefully, the system improves soon.'"
