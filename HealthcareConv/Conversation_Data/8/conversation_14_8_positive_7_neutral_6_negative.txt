"Speaker A: 'I reviewed the recent updates to the care plans, and I must say, the improvements are remarkable.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the team really focused on patient-centric changes, and it’s showing positive results.'

Speaker A: 'Speaking of the team, how’s the communication going these days? Any changes?'

Speaker B: 'It’s been steady. No major issues, but there’s always room for improvement, especially in sharing updates promptly.'
