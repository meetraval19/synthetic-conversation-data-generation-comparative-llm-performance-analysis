"Speaker A: 'I’m glad we’re seeing such progress with your care plan updates. The new therapy strategy is showing great results.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it feels like we’re on the right track. The changes in medication and the new exercises seem to be working well.'

Speaker A: 'That’s wonderful to hear! On the other side, have you started thinking about the next steps for when discharge comes up?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, the idea of discharge is a bit daunting. Managing everything at home without constant support might be difficult.'

Speaker A: 'It’s understandable to feel that way. We can look into additional home care resources to ease that transition.'

Speaker B: 'That would definitely help. I just want to ensure the continuity of care and prevent any setbacks once I’m home.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we’ll make sure every detail is covered. Let’s focus first on maintaining this positive momentum with your current plan.'"
