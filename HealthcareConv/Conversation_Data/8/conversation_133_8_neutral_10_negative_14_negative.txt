Speaker B: 'Yes, though ensuring everything aligns with their long-term goals is key.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. I’m more concerned about therapy adherence. The reports suggest some challenges there.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed the same. It seems the patient is struggling to follow through consistently. This could impact their recovery significantly.'
