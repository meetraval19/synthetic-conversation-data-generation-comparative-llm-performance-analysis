Speaker B: 'I was worried about that. Is it something serious?'

Speaker A: 'There are a few markers that need attention, but we've caught them early, which is good.'

Speaker B: 'That's a relief, somewhat. What do we do next?'

Speaker A: 'I’ve put together a treatment plan that should work well for you. It includes a combination of medication and lifestyle adjustments.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds promising. Will I start noticing a difference soon?'
