Speaker B: 'That's a relief. It's always uplifting when the results align with our efforts.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, about how we shared the findings with the families, I'm considering if our approach was clear enough.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the communication part can be tricky. We need to ensure everything is understood but without causing unnecessary worry.'

Speaker A: 'There was some feedback that showed varied reactions, though nothing major.'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps we can refine our method to make it more consistent. A standardized approach could help in maintaining neutrality in the communication.' 

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a solid plan. Let's aim for clarity while delivering such sensitive information.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. We should discuss this further with the team to gather more insights and improve our process.'"
