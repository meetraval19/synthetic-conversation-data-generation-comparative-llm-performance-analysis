Speaker B: 'Oh, that's such a relief! I was feeling a bit anxious about them.'

Speaker A: 'Understandable, but you’ve made great progress, and it’s clear from the results.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you for keeping me informed. What’s next in the process?'

Speaker A: 'We’ll review the discharge papers next. It’s a standard procedure, just to make sure everything is in order.'
