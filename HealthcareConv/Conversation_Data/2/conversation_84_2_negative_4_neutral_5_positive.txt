"Speaker A: 'I understand you’ve seen the test results. It's not quite what we were hoping for.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it was disappointing to hear. Does this change the treatment plan significantly?'

Speaker A: 'Not entirely. We'll stay on the same course for now, monitoring closely how you respond.'

Speaker B: 'I see. So there's no need to make major adjustments at this point?'

Speaker A: 'Correct. It’s important to stay consistent, but I'm optimistic about your follow-up appointments.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Are the follow-ups scheduled regularly?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We’ll check in every few weeks to assess progress and modify the approach if needed.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds good. It's nice to know there’s a structured plan moving forward.'

Speaker A: 'Having these regular check-ins really helps. We're here to support you throughout this process.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. That gives me some peace of mind about what's next.'"
