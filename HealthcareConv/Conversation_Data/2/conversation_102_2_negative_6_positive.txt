"Speaker A: 'Hello, I’m glad you could come in today. I wanted to talk about your recent test results.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve been a bit anxious about them. Is everything okay?'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, the results aren’t as we hoped. There are some areas of concern that we need to address.'

Speaker B: 'That’s not what I was expecting to hear. What are the next steps?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Your comfort is our priority, and I’m confident the specialist will have more answers for you.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks for the help. I feel a bit better knowing you’re taking care of the referral.'"
