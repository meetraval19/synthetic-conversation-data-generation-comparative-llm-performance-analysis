"Speaker A: 'I see you've come in for your follow-up appointment. How have things been since your last visit?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, not great. I feel like there hasn't been much improvement, and it's a bit disheartening.'

Speaker A: 'I understand how that can be frustrating. Let's focus on reviewing your medication today. We've seen some positive responses in others with similar conditions.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring to hear. Could a change in medication really make a difference?'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Sometimes a small adjustment can have significant results. I think it's worth exploring new options to see if we can improve your situation.'

Speaker B: 'That gives me some hope. It's encouraging to know there might be a better path forward.'"
