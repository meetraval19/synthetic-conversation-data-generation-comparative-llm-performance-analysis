"Speaker A: 'Hi there, how have you been since your last visit?'

Speaker B: 'I’ve been okay, just trying to keep up with all the follow-up instructions.'

Speaker A: 'That’s understandable. Keeping track of appointments can be a bit tedious.'

Speaker A: 'You’re welcome. Do you have any other questions or concerns?'

Speaker B: 'No, I think that covers it for now. I appreciate the support and guidance.'

Speaker A: 'Anytime. We’re here to help whenever you need it.'"
