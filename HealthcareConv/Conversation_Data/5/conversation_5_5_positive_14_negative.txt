"Speaker A: 'So, before you leave, let's go over the next steps. Your follow-up appointment has been scheduled for next week, and the team is excited to see your progress.'

Speaker B: 'Great, I’m looking forward to that. It's reassuring to know everything is set up for my recovery.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, about your medications—have you experienced any side effects that we should address?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, actually. I've noticed some dizziness since I started them.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. It’s important for us to manage these side effects carefully. We might need to adjust your dosage or try an alternative medication.'

Speaker B: 'That would be a relief. It’s been a bit uncomfortable.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We’ll make sure to find a solution that works better for you. We can also discuss this during your follow-up if there are any more changes.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, that would be helpful. I’m really glad the follow-up plan is clear and supportive.'

Speaker A: 'Of course, keeping you comfortable and on track is our priority. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything else comes up before your appointment.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you so much for all your help. I'll be sure to let you know if anything changes.'

Speaker A: 'You're welcome. Take care, and we’ll see you soon at the follow-up.'"
