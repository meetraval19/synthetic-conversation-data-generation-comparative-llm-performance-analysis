"Speaker A: 'The follow-up after the incident was quite thorough, don’t you think?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the review process went smoothly and covered all the necessary details.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about the treatment plan during the emergency, I felt it didn’t address all the specific needs effectively.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. There were some gaps that left us scrambling for better options.'

Speaker A: 'The lack of coordination on decisions didn’t help either. Everyone seemed out of sync.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It felt like we weren't fully on the same page, which hindered timely decision-making.' 

Speaker A: 'We need to find ways to improve our shared decision process to prevent this confusion in the future.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It’s crucial we streamline that communication for better outcomes next time.'"
