"Speaker A: 'So, we’re getting ready for your discharge, but we need to set a follow-up appointment soon.'

Speaker B: 'Do I really have to come back so soon? I was hoping to make it a bit later.'

Speaker A: 'It’s important to ensure everything is progressing well, especially with your recent treatment.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, but it’s a bit inconvenient given my schedule.'

Speaker A: 'I get that, but it’s crucial for your recovery. Let’s see if we can work out the timing.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, I guess I’ll manage. What about all the paperwork?'

Speaker A: 'Good question. Let’s go over everything now. It won’t take too long.'

Speaker B: 'I looked at it earlier, and it seemed straightforward, but I want to make sure everything’s accurate.'

Speaker A: 'That’s definitely important. We can go through each section together to ensure there are no mistakes.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, I appreciate that. I just want everything in order before I leave.'
