"Speaker A: 'Let's discuss the recent patient assessments. How's everyone managing follow-ups?' 

Speaker B: 'Most of them are on schedule, but there are some delays due to resource constraints.'

Speaker C: 'That's understandable. As long as we're consistent, the overall process should flow smoothly.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Consistency is key with follow-ups. Now, about our approach on collaborative decision-making, I've noticed some concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've seen it too. We've had challenges ensuring that patients feel included in the decision process.'

Speaker C: 'It’s tricky. Sometimes it feels like there's a gap between what we offer and what the patients expect.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to find a way to better communicate and align expectations with them.' 

Speaker B: 'True. It’s crucial we address this to improve patient satisfaction.' 

Speaker C: 'Maybe we could review the decision-making framework to make it more inclusive and transparent for our patients.'"
