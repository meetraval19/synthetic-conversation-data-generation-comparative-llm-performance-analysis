Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Just concerned about keeping up with the treatment once I’m home.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Therapy adherence can be challenging, but we’ll provide you with all the support you need.'

Speaker B: 'It does feel overwhelming, especially keeping track of everything.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Reviewing the documents might give me more confidence in managing everything.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let's focus on maintaining a clear plan. And remember, we’re just a call away if you need guidance.'

Speaker B: 'Having clear documentation is reassuring. I'll definitely use it as a reference.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. You’re more prepared than you think!'"
