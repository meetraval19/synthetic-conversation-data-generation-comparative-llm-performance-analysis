"Speaker A: 'So, I see you've done well with your treatment plan over the past few weeks.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've tried to follow the therapy schedule as closely as possible.'

Speaker A: 'That's great. Sticking to the routine can really make a difference.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, though I sometimes wonder if the medications are more manageable with fewer side effects.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It’s crucial for both of us to have an open discussion about your preferences and concerns.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, sometimes it feels like the decisions are made without fully considering how I feel.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry it feels that way. Let’s work together to ensure that your voice is heard as we make decisions moving forward.'

Speaker B: 'That would be reassuring. I just want to feel like we're working as a team.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let's go over any adjustments you might need now and in the future.'"
