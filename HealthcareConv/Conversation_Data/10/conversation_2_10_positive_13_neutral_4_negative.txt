"Speaker A: 'It's great to see you're keeping up with your therapy sessions. How are you feeling about them?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, they've been really helpful. I feel a lot more positive and able to manage my day-to-day life.'

Speaker A: 'That's excellent to hear. Adherence can really make a difference. Let’s discuss the plan moving forward after your discharge.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I know it’s important, but I’m feeling a bit unsure about all the details involved with going home.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It’s a lot to take in. We can go over each step to make it clearer for you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. I’d like to make sure I have everything sorted before leaving the hospital.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. We’ll ensure you feel prepared. Now, about your current treatment plan, have you encountered any challenges?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, yes. I’m finding some parts difficult to manage, and it’s been a bit overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'I see. It’s not uncommon to face hurdles. We can certainly adjust the plan to better suit your needs.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. I really want to continue making progress but in a way that feels manageable for me.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let’s work together to make it more effective for you. Your feedback is very important.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It makes me feel more involved in my own care.'"
