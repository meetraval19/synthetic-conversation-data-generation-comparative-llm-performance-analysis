"Speaker A: 'So, we’re reviewing everything before you leave. Have you been keeping up with your therapy sessions?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, pretty consistently. I feel it helps, but it can be a bit routine at times.'

Speaker A: 'That's understandable. Consistency is key, though. How about your symptom log? How have you found the assessment process?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it’s been frustrating. Some symptoms seem to be overlooked, and I don't feel like we’re getting a complete picture.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. We’ll make sure to address those concerns in your follow-up. As for our team communication, have there been any issues you've noticed?'

Speaker B: 'There have been a few times when messages from different team members didn’t match up. It can be quite confusing and makes me anxious about my next steps.'

Speaker A: 'I apologize for any confusion. We’ll work on improving our coordination, ensuring everyone’s on the same page.' 

Speaker B: 'I really hope so. It would make the process much smoother.' 

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Your feedback is valuable, and we’re committed to making the necessary improvements for everyone’s benefit.'"
