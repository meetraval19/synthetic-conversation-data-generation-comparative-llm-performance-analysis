"Speaker A: 'I've noticed that some patients are having trouble sticking to their therapy schedules lately.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. We've had a few cases where adherence wasn't as good as we'd hoped. We might need to look into additional support mechanisms.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Perhaps more personalized follow-ups could help improve those numbers.'

Speaker B: 'On the brighter side, our process for coordinating referrals has really improved. Patients are getting the specialists they need much more smoothly now.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the feedback on that has been very positive. Our new system seems to be making a big difference.'

Speaker B: 'Itâ€™s wonderful to see how streamlined it's become. Patients appreciate how quickly they're being connected with the right care.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely! Now, if we can get therapy adherence back on track, it will make a huge difference in overall patient outcomes.'"
