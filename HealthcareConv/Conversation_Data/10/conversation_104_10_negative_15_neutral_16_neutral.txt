"Speaker A: 'I see that you’ve been advised to stick closely to your rehabilitation exercises.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, but honestly, keeping up with the therapy has been quite challenging for me.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Let’s work together to find a schedule that fits your routine better.'

Speaker B: 'That would be really helpful. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to manage it all.'

Speaker A: 'Also, during your last consultation, did you feel comfortable discussing the treatment plan?'

Speaker B: 'It was a bit of a mixed feeling. I was informed about the options, but deciding felt a bit complicated.'

Speaker A: 'Shared decision-making can be a bit overwhelming. It's crucial you feel heard and involved.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It would be great to have more clarity as we go along.'

Speaker A: 'Regarding your diagnosis, do you feel everything was communicated clearly to you?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the explanations were clear enough. It was straightforward, which I appreciated.'

Speaker A: 'That’s good to hear. Clear communication is vital. If you have any more questions or concerns, please reach out.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely will. Thank you for understanding and for your support.'
