"Speaker A: 'I've noticed that some patients aren't sticking to their therapy plans as much as we'd like.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, therapy adherence can be quite a challenge these days. Many factors affect it, from personal motivation to side effects.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and addressing it requires a lot of support and understanding from our side.'

Speaker B: 'We should look closely at how we provide that support, maybe explore different methods of engagement.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Speaking of which, have you had a chance to review the latest documentation for our referral process?'

Speaker B: 'I did. It seems straightforward enough, but there are always those small areas where we can streamline.'

Speaker A: 'True, it's an ongoing process, but no major issues at least.'

Speaker B: 'Right, it's all about constant improvement, ensuring everything is as efficient as possible.'"
