"Speaker A: 'It's important to keep up with your prescribed exercises once you get home.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. The therapist went over everything, and it seems manageable.'

Speaker A: 'Consistency is key. Now, about the post-discharge support, have you explored any local services?'

Speaker B: 'I did, but I'm a bit concerned about their availability and quality.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. I'm hoping to find something reliable soon to ensure smooth recovery.'

Speaker A: 'Hopefully, with time, you'll be able to find support that meets your needs.'"
