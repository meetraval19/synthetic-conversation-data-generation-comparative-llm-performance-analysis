Speaker B: 'It really has been. I find it difficult to follow the routine consistently.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. On the bright side, many patients feel better after adjusting to the initial phase.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring to hear. Honestly, I’m quite relieved that the side effects weren’t as bad as I feared.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, some people even report feeling better with the slight adjustments.'

Speaker B: 'I’ll make sure to update them regularly. It’ll probably ease some of these concerns.'
