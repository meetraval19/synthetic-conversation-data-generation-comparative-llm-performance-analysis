Speaker B: 'Absolutely, consistent adherence is crucial, and it's encouraging to see such commitment.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, I’m concerned about how the decision-making process went last time. The patient seemed overwhelmed with the options presented.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, some adjustments are needed to make the plan more straightforward for everyone involved.'
