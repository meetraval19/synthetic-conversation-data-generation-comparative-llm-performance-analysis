"Speaker A: 'I see from your records that therapy adherence has been a bit challenging for you.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been tough to stick to the regimen. The timing and frequency sometimes feel overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, it can be difficult to manage, but we can explore solutions to make it easier for you.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. I’ve been trying, but I often miss sessions.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s also look at your discharge plan. It seems pretty straightforward, but are there any concerns you have about it?'

Speaker B: 'Not really, although I do wonder about how things will unfold once I'm back home.'

Speaker A: 'We’ll make sure everything is clear before you leave. On a positive note, your recent medication review shows good progress.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! I was a bit anxious about it.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the adjustments have been effective, and you're responding well.'

Speaker B: 'Good to know. I’ll focus more on keeping up with that part of the plan.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a good approach. We’ll continue to support you through each step.'"
