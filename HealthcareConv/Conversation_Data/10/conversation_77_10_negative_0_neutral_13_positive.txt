“Speaker A: 'Before you leave, we should go over your discharge plan. It’s looking really promising, and I think you’ll have a smooth transition home.'

Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear. I just want to make sure everything is covered, especially since my past medical records are quite extensive.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, your medical history is all well-documented, and we’ve taken it into account. It shouldn’t affect the new plan significantly.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. I’ve been a bit concerned about sticking to the therapy schedule though. I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep up with it like I should.'

Speaker A: 'It can be challenging, but perhaps we can find some strategies or support that could help improve adherence. It’s crucial for your recovery.'

Speaker B: 'I know, I’ll try my best. I guess the main thing is getting started with this new plan. It sounds like a step in the right direction.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the plan is very comprehensive and tailored to your needs, so feel free to reach out if you need any help along the way.'”
