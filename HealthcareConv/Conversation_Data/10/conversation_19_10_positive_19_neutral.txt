Speaker B: 'Thanks! Sticking to it has been easier than I expected, and I do feel an improvement.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. Adherence really makes a difference in outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and it's motivating to see progress. But I have been wondering about other resources available.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. I’ll consider which supports might fit my schedule and preferences.' 

Speaker A: 'Great, let’s keep the communication open as you try things out.'"
