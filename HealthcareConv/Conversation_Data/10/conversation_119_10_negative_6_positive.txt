"Speaker A: 'I noticed you’ve missed a few therapy sessions recently. Is there a particular reason for that?'

Speaker B: 'I wish I could say there’s not, but keeping up with the schedule has been really tough. It's overwhelming sometimes.'

Speaker A: 'I understand how challenging that can be. Let’s work together to find a way to make it more manageable for you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. I really want to make this work but sometimes it feels like a losing battle.'

Speaker A: 'On a brighter note, I’ve got some good news regarding your referrals. We’ve streamlined the process, and coordination is much smoother now.'

Speaker B: 'Really? That’s great to hear! It was becoming a hassle trying to keep track of all the different appointments and specialists.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We’re making sure everything is interconnected and seamless for your peace of mind.'

Speaker B: 'That takes a weight off my shoulders. I appreciate the effort you’re putting in to make this smoother for me.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. Let’s tackle the therapy schedule next and see what adjustments can be made to better fit your needs.'

Speaker B: 'I’d appreciate that. Knowing you’re supportive makes a huge difference.'"
