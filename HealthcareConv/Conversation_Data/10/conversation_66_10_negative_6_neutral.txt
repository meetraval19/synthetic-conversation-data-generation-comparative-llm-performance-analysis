Speaker B: 'It’s been a challenge ensuring therapy adherence. Maybe we need to revisit our engagement strategies.'

Speaker C: 'Definitely, we should identify the factors contributing to non-adherence so we can address them effectively.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, our referral process seems to be running smoothly.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the coordination between departments has been consistent. It's key to maintaining seamless patient transitions.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed, but we should monitor it closely to sustain this level of efficiency.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and perhaps a periodic review could help us catch any potential issues early.'
