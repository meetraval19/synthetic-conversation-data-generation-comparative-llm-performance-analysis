"Speaker A: 'I noticed you're having some challenges with sticking to your therapy sessions. Do you want to talk about what's been difficult?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it’s been tough. The schedule just doesn’t seem to fit with my work, and I’m often too exhausted to attend.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It can be overwhelming. We can explore some alternatives or adjust the timing to make it more manageable for you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be really helpful. I don’t want to fall behind on my progress.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we want to ensure you're supported. On a different note, I’ve coordinated referrals with a specialist who can provide additional insights for your condition.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, that’s great news! I didn’t know it could be done so seamlessly.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we've streamlined the process to ensure you get the care you need without unnecessary delays.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds perfect. Thank you for organizing that. It takes a lot off my mind knowing you’re handling the details.'

Speaker A: 'My pleasure. Let’s address those scheduling conflicts and keep everything on track for you.'"
