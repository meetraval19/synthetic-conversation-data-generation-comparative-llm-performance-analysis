"Speaker A: 'Hi there, I see that your attendance in therapy sessions has been a bit irregular lately.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I’ve been struggling to keep up. Life's been overwhelming, and it's hard to stick to the schedule.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It’s important, though, to try and follow the treatment plan. Missing sessions can slow down progress.'

Speaker B: 'I know, and I’m working on it. I just feel like I’m not seeing the results I was hoping for.'

Speaker A: 'It can be frustrating, but sometimes the benefits aren’t immediate. Let’s work together to find ways to make it easier for you to attend.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. I really want to get back on track.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about the ongoing situation, have you had any sudden concerns that might require urgent attention?'

Speaker B: 'Thankfully, no major issues so far, just a few minor things. But I worry about what to do if something unexpected happens.'

Speaker A: 'That’s reasonable. Having a plan can help with peace of mind. We can also arrange for regular check-ins to address any concerns you might have.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It takes a load off knowing I have support.'
