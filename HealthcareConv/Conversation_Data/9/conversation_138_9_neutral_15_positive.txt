"Speaker A: 'I was looking over your test results, and there are a few things to consider. The assessment shows some areas we need to monitor closely.'

Speaker B: 'I see. So, there are potential risks I should be aware of?' 

Speaker A: 'Yes, but at this stage, the focus is more on keeping an eye on things. It's more about monitoring than immediate concern.'

Speaker B: 'That's somewhat reassuring. What about making decisions on how to move forward?'

Speaker A: 'That's where we get to collaborate. I think it's important we weigh the options together. Shared decision-making can lead to better outcomes for you.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad to hear that. Having a say in my treatment plan feels empowering and positive.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We'll ensure you have all the information you need to make choices that align with your values and preferences.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds good. I'm ready to be actively involved in the process.'

Speaker A: 'Great! We'll work through it step by step, ensuring you feel supported at every turn.'"
