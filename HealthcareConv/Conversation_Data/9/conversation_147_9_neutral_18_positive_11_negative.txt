Speaker B: 'Now, regarding our emergency protocols, I must say they’ve been exceptionally streamlined recently.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, the enhancements in handling urgent situations have been impressive. The integration of new tech has been a game-changer.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It's reassuring to see how quickly patients can receive care when emergencies arise now.'
