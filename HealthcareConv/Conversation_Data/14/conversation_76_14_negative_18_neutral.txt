"Speaker A: 'I wanted to talk about how you've been feeling since you started the new medication.'

Speaker B: 'Well, to be honest, I’ve been experiencing some trouble. I've noticed nausea and fatigue quite a bit.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. Those can definitely be challenging side effects. Let's see how we can manage or reduce them.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. It’s been hard to go about my day normally.'

Speaker A: 'We can adjust the dosage or consider an alternative. Let’s monitor it closely for now.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I appreciate that. I also wanted to ask about what I should do in case of an unexpected issue, like a sudden feeling of dizziness.'

Speaker A: 'That's a good question. If something severe occurs, you should seek immediate help. But for mild symptoms, you can contact our office for guidance.'

Speaker B: 'Got it. And if it's something like dizziness, is it urgent?'

Speaker A: 'If it's persistent or worsening, it's best to contact us or visit the nearest clinic. Better to stay safe.'

Speaker B: 'Makes sense. I’ll keep an eye on it and reach out if needed.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, staying informed about your symptoms is key. Let’s schedule a follow-up in a few weeks to reassess.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you, that sounds good. I feel a bit more at ease knowing the plan.'
