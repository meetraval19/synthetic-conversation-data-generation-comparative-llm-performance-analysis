"Speaker A: 'I understand you're concerned about what we discussed last time. Have you experienced any reactions so far?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, actually, I've been feeling quite off since starting the new medication. The side effects are really bothersome.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. It's important we address those promptly. Let's discuss coordinating a referral to a specialist. How do you feel about that?'

Speaker B: 'I'm open to it, though I'm not exactly sure how this process works.'

Speaker A: 'No worries, we can work through it together. I'll handle the logistics and make sure everything is coordinated seamlessly.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds good. I appreciate your help. I want to make sure we're considering all options.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Shared decision-making is key here. We want to ensure you feel confident about every step.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, having someone guide me through the options makes a big difference.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Letâ€™s keep the communication open as we move forward. Your comfort and health are our priorities.'"
