"Speaker A: 'Hi, I wanted to discuss the new medication you prescribed. I’ve been reading about how people sometimes experience side effects.'

Speaker B: 'That’s understandable, but many patients find that any initial side effects are often mild and manageable. We’ll monitor you closely to ensure everything is going well.'

Speaker A: 'That’s reassuring to hear. On another note, I was wondering about getting a referral to a specialist.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, coordinating referrals can be straightforward. I’ll ensure the process is as smooth as possible for you.'

Speaker A: 'Great, I appreciate that. It’s good to know that the system is set up to handle these things efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, our goal is to make sure everything is coordinated properly, so you have the best care possible.'"
