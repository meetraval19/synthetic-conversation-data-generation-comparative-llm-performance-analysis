Speaker B: 'That's reassuring to hear. I've been anxious about how I'd feel after starting it.'

Speaker A: 'Understandable. However, the recent blood test results weren't as promising as we hoped.'

Speaker B: 'Oh no, that's disappointing. What do they indicate?'

Speaker B: 'I see. I was also confused by the way my diagnosis was explained initially.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Communicating diagnoses can sometimes be challenging, but let's clarify anything that's unclear now.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, please. I really want to fully understand what's happening with my health.'"
