"Speaker A: 'Congratulations on reaching the point of discharge! How are you feeling about everything?'

Speaker B: 'Pretty good, especially since we’ve managed those side effects quite well.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. The medication adjustments seemed to work in your favor.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, absolutely. However, I have some concerns about the way decisions were made during my stay.'

Speaker A: 'I see. Shared decision-making can sometimes feel, well, a bit frustrating when preferences get overlooked.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. I felt like I wasn’t included as much as I should have been.'

Speaker A: 'I’m really sorry you felt that way. We aim to improve on that.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks. And about the follow-up appointment, I’ve been told it’s still being arranged?'

Speaker A: 'I apologize for the delay in referral coordination. It’s something we’re actively working on improving.'

Speaker B: 'I hope so. It’s crucial for my peace of mind going forward.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and we’re committed to ensuring it’s sorted out efficiently this time. Let’s make sure your transition home is as smooth as possible.'

Speaker B: 'That would mean a lot. Thank you for addressing these issues with me.'"
