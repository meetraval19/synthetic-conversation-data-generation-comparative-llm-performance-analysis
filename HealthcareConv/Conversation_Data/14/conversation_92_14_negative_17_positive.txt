"Speaker A: 'I've noticed some discomfort since starting the new medication.' 

Speaker B: 'I'm sorry to hear about that. Can you describe what you're experiencing?'

Speaker A: 'Mainly nausea and a bit of dizziness in the mornings.'

Speaker B: 'Those do sound troubling. Let's see if we can adjust your treatment to minimize these side effects.'

Speaker A: 'That would be great. I really want to continue the treatment but without these issues.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. On another note, how's your experience with accessing care and support services?'

Speaker A: 'Surprisingly, it's been quite smooth. I've had more access to care resources than before.'

Speaker B: 'That's wonderful to hear. Removing those barriers is essential for effective treatment.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's made a huge difference, knowing I can reach out whenever needed.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad to hear that. Let's work together on managing those initial concerns.'"
