"Speaker A: 'Thanks for coming in today. How have you been feeling since starting the new medication?'

Speaker B: 'I've noticed some unpleasant reactions, actually. It’s been a bit worrying.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?'

Speaker B: 'I’ve been having frequent headaches and some nausea.'

Speaker A: 'Those side effects can be quite troublesome. Let’s adjust your dosage and monitor your symptoms closely.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a good plan. I just hope it improves soon.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, let’s review your discharge plan. How do you feel about it?'

Speaker B: 'I think it’s manageable. There are quite a few steps, but nothing overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'Great to hear. Remember, your care team is here to support you. Do you have any concerns about your follow-up appointments?'

Speaker B: 'Not really. I appreciate the clear schedule.'

Speaker A: 'Glad to know it’s clear. We’ll check in regularly to make sure everything’s on track.'"
