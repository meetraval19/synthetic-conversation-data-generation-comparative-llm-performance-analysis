"Speaker A: 'I've noticed our team has been proactive in managing potential complications from treatments lately.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! Patients have been reporting fewer issues, which is wonderful.'

Speaker A: 'It's great to hear. But I am concerned about the follow-up process after patient's discharge.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, we’ve had a few challenges ensuring smooth transitions once patients leave our care.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we should reassess our current protocols and find ways to improve communication with outpatient facilities.'

Speaker B: 'That's a good idea. Working on a more structured plan could really help reduce readmissions.'

Speaker A: 'Meanwhile, let’s continue focusing on minimizing any adverse reactions as we've been doing so well with that.'

Speaker B: 'For sure. If we can resolve the discharge process issues, our overall service will be more comprehensive.'"
