"Speaker A: 'I'm really concerned about the possible adverse reactions these medications might cause.'

Speaker B: 'That's understandable. Some patients do experience these issues, but not everyone does.'

Speaker A: 'Right, but I've read about some common ones that seem quite uncomfortable.'

Speaker B: 'True, and it's crucial to be aware of them. We'll monitor any signs of discomfort closely and adjust if needed.'

Speaker A: 'Thank you, I'd appreciate that. Also, I wondered about what steps we should take if there's an urgent situation.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. While it's important to remain calm, having an emergency plan is wise. We can discuss the steps to take and ensure you know exactly what to do.'

Speaker A: 'That would really help alleviate some of my concerns. Thank you for addressing these points with me clearly.'
