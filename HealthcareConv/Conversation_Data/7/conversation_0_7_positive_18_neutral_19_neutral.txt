"Speaker A: 'I'm glad to see you today for your follow-up. How have you been since our last visit?'

Speaker B: 'I’ve been doing well, thank you. I really appreciate how well your team communicates. It makes scheduling and follow-ups seamless.'

Speaker A: 'I'm pleased to hear that. We prioritize clear communication to ensure everyone stays informed.'

Speaker B: 'It definitely makes a difference. However, I did have a moment last week when I was unsure if my symptoms required emergency attention.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful, thank you. It’s good to know there’s support when necessary.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, ensuring you feel supported is our priority. Let’s continue to monitor your progress and adjust if needed.'"
