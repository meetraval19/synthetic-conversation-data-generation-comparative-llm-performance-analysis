“Speaker A: 'I've noticed some gaps in our team communication lately, and it's impacting our efficiency.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Miscommunications have led to delays, especially with patient updates.'

Speaker C: 'Maybe we should look into better tools or strategies to streamline our information sharing?'

Speaker A: 'That's a good point. Moving on, how’s the process going for coordinating referrals?'

Speaker A: 'Let's focus on enhancing our internal team communication first, and see how that positively affects our referral process too.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a plan. Improving communication should help both areas.'"
