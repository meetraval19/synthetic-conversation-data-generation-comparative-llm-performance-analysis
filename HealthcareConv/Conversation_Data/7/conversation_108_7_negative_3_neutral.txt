"Speaker A: 'In our last few meetings, we've noticed some gaps in how we communicate within the team.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been challenging to keep everyone on the same page, especially with all the overlapping schedules.'

Speaker C: 'Exactly, and it sometimes feels like crucial updates aren't reaching all of us in time.'

Speaker A: 'We need to find a better way to ensure messages are disseminated effectively.'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps setting up a structured communication protocol could help.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed. Now, moving to our medication review process, how are we doing with the new system?'

Speaker A: 'It's fairly neutral, I thinkâ€”it's neither been overwhelmingly positive nor problematic.'

Speaker C: 'Indeed. It might just take some more time for us to adapt and streamline everything.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, with continuous feedback, we should be able to smooth out any remaining issues.'"
