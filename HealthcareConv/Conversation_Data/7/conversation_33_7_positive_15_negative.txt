"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how well the healthcare team communicated during your stay.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, they were always on top of things, ensuring everyone was informed.'

Speaker A: 'That made a big difference in how smoothly everything went, didn't it?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It was comforting to know that everyone was working together seamlessly.'

Speaker A: 'However, I noticed that when it came to deciding on the discharge plan, it felt a bit unilateral.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It seemed like the decisions were made without fully considering my concerns.'

Speaker A: 'That can be frustrating. Feeling involved in your own care is crucial.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It would have been better if I had more input regarding the timing and the follow-up care.'

Speaker A: 'I'll make sure to communicate that feedback. It's important to have everyone on the same page for shared decisions.'"
