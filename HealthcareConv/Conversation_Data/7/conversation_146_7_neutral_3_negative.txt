Speaker B: 'It's been smooth overall. Everyone kept me well-informed about what was happening.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. Let's go over your medication list carefully. There were some concerns we need to address.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, is there an issue with the medications? I noticed there were changes.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate the heads-up. I was feeling a bit uneasy about the changes.'

Speaker A: 'It's understandable. Please reach out if you notice anything unusual once you're home.'
