"Speaker A: 'I'm really impressed with how well our team communicates these days. It's made such a difference in patient outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The way everyone collaborates during rounds has significantly improved. It feels like weâ€™re all on the same wavelength.'

Speaker A: 'And it shows in the feedback we're getting. Patients notice when their care team is cohesive.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. However, we still encounter challenges with certain administrative processes. Sometimes they act as barriers to providing the best care.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, navigating those hurdles can be tough. But identifying these obstacles is the first step toward improvement.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. If we can streamline some of these processes, we'll be able to focus even more on patient care.'"
