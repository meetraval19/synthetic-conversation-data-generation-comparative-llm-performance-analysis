"Speaker A: 'I must say, the way you and your team kept me informed throughout my treatment has been fantastic.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you! We believe strong communication helps patients feel more at ease. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?'

Speaker A: 'Well, I have some worries about what to do if my situation suddenly worsens.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Emergencies can be quite stressful. We're here to ensure you have all the necessary contacts and action plans.'

Speaker A: 'That’s comforting to know. However, I still feel somewhat overwhelmed by all the medical information.'

Speaker B: 'I hear you. It's challenging when there's so much to process. We can go over any information you're unsure about to make it clearer.'

Speaker A: 'I’d appreciate that. Feeling more informed would make managing this easier.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, let’s make sure you have all the resources you need to feel confident.'”
