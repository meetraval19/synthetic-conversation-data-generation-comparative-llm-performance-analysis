"Speaker A: 'I'm really pleased with how our team has been collaborating lately. It's making a real difference in our project outcomes.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The way everyone is pitching in during our weekly check-ins is impressive.'

Speaker A: 'On the other hand, managing referrals has been quite challenging. The coordination just isn’t as smooth as it should be.'

Speaker B: 'I know, the delays are frustrating. It sometimes feels like we’re working in silos when it comes to that.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need a better system to ensure timely updates on referral status. But let’s keep focused on streamlining our processes.'

Speaker B: 'Good point. Maybe we can brainstorm some strategies next meeting to tackle this issue. Meanwhile, let's keep leveraging our strong teamwork.'"
