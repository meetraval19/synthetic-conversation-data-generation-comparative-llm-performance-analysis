"Speaker A: 'I've noticed some issues with how our team is communicating lately, and it's been affecting our efficiency.' 

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's been difficult to keep everyone on the same page, and it’s definitely something we need to address soon.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, how’s our coordination with external specialists going?'

Speaker B: 'It's been fairly steady. We’ve established a good process, but there's always room for improvement.'

Speaker A: 'Good to hear. And what about the recent trial findings on treatment reactions?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, that's some great news. The reduced side effects reported are really encouraging, and patients are responding well.'

Speaker A: 'That's fantastic! Let’s focus on those positive outcomes while we work through the communication challenges.'"
