Speaker B: 'I’ve been feeling better, so it seems to be working well.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. However, I did want to touch upon something else. Have you had any issues communicating with different specialists on the team?'

Speaker B: 'Actually, yes. Sometimes getting everyone on the same page has been a bit frustrating.'
