Speaker B: 'Honestly, it's been wonderful. The nurses and specialists have been so clear and helpful every step of the way. It makes a huge difference.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. We're always striving to make sure everyone is on the same page for the best care. Now, about your care plan. I know we had to make some adjustments recently. How are you feeling about those changes?'

Speaker B: 'To be honest, it’s been a bit frustrating. I was hoping we wouldn't need to change anything, but I understand it’s for the best.'

Speaker A: 'I completely understand how that can be disheartening. Sometimes these updates are necessary to ensure you're getting the most effective treatment. Let's discuss any concerns you have and try to address them together.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. I guess I just need some time to adjust to the new schedule.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, take your time. We're here to support you with anything you need during this transition.'"
