"Speaker A: 'I’ve noticed our team communication has been a bit off lately, especially during shift handovers.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It sometimes feels chaotic, and we miss critical updates.'

Speaker C: 'Maybe we need a better system to ensure everyone gets the same information at the start of each shift.'

Speaker A: 'That would help. On a brighter note, our response to emergencies has improved a lot.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! The new protocol has made a big difference in how quickly we can react.'

Speaker C: 'The drills have really paid off; everyone seems more confident now.'

Speaker A: 'It’s crucial to build on that success and ensure our communication during everyday tasks matches our emergency response.'

Speaker B: 'Right, optimizing both areas will improve overall patient care and team morale.'

Speaker C: 'We should start by organizing a meeting to address communication gaps and exchange feedback on our emergency procedures.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a plan. Let’s get this on the calendar soon.'"
