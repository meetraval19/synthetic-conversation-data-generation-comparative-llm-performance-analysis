"Speaker A: 'So, let's go over your discharge plan. How did you find the communication between the healthcare team during your stay?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it was a bit frustrating. Sometimes, it seemed like the doctors and nurses were not on the same page.'

Speaker A: 'I understand how that can be difficult. We'll make sure to address these issues for future patients. Now, letâ€™s review your medications before you leave.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I actually felt really reassured after discussing the new prescriptions with the pharmacist.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. It's important you feel confident about your medication plan. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I feel much better knowing what to expect and how to manage everything at home.'

Speaker A: 'Excellent. We want to ensure a smooth transition, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need further clarification.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Hopefully, next time the team communication improves, but overall I'm ready to head home.'

Speaker A: 'We'll definitely work on it. Safe recovery, and we're just a call away if you need us.'"
