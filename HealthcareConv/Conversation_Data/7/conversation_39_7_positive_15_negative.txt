"Speaker A: 'I've noticed a real improvement in how the doctors and nurses communicate with each other in this clinic.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the coordination between the team really makes a difference in patient care. It feels like everyoneâ€™s on the same page.'

Speaker A: 'It's reassuring to see. However, I'm still a bit worried about making decisions together when it comes to treatment plans.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Sometimes it feels like the final decision isn't as collaborative as it should be.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, I feel a bit sidelined during those critical discussions.'

Speaker B: 'It can be frustrating. Perhaps there could be more focus on involving us patients actively.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I think having a more guided approach could really help improve confidence in the decisions being made for our health.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Meanwhile, it's comforting to know the medical staff communicates effectively amongst themselves.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, hopefully, they'll work on making the decision-making process more inclusive as well.'"
