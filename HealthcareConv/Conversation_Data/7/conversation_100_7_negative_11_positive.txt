Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been a bit frustrating. A recent mix-up with patient files caused unnecessary delays.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, addressing these issues is crucial to prevent them from affecting patient care.'

Speaker B: 'On a brighter note, the efforts we're putting into educating our patients have been really rewarding.'
