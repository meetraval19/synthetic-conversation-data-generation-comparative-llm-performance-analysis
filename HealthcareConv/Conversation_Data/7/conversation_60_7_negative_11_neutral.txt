"Speaker A: 'Hi, how have things been since your last appointment?'

Speaker B: 'Not too bad, but I did notice something during my hospital stay.'

Speaker A: 'Oh? What was that?'

Speaker B: 'The coordination among the medical team seemed a bit off. They often repeated questions and sometimes it felt like they weren't on the same page.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. We strive for seamless team communication, but I’ll definitely bring this up in our next meeting.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. Aside from that, I’ve been reading up on managing my condition.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great! There’s a lot of good information out there.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, but sometimes it’s overwhelming, trying to figure out what’s most relevant.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, it can be confusing. Feel free to ask any questions you have, and I can help clarify.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I’ll make sure to reach out if anything comes up.' 

Speaker A: 'Anytime. Let’s work together to make sure you feel supported both in and out of the clinic.'"
