"Speaker A: 'I've noticed our team communication could use some improvement. There have been too many instances where important information wasn't relayed effectively.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's been challenging when messages don’t get across in time.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it affects our workflow. On a different note, how are we handling our assessments?'

Speaker B: 'I think our approach to handling potential risks is systematic. It seems to be working, but there’s always room for enhancement.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, though I believe we are on the right track. The systems in place are stable and we've managed to prevent major issues.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, and what about the coordination for referrals?'

Speaker A: 'It's steady. The process isn't as streamlined as it could be, but it matches our needs for now.'

Speaker B: 'I see. It's functioning, but we might want to explore ways to optimize it further.'"
