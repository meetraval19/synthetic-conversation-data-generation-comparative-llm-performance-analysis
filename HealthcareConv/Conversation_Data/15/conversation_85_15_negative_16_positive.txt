"Speaker A: 'I wanted to discuss how we've been handling the shared decision-making process with our patients.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've noticed it can be quite challenging at times. Patients often feel overwhelmed by all the information.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's important, but sometimes it feels like it adds stress to their decision-making.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We might need to streamline the approach or provide additional support.'

Speaker A: 'On a positive note, I've seen great improvements in how we communicate diagnoses recently.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve noticed that too. Patients seem to really appreciate the clear explanations and feel more at ease.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the more transparent we are, the better they can process their options and next steps.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. It’s reassuring to know our efforts in that area are making a difference.'"
