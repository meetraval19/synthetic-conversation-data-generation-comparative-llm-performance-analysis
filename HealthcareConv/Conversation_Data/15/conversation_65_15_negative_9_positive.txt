"Speaker A: 'I've noticed that involving patients in decision-making hasn't always gone smoothly.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, some patients feel their opinions aren't fully considered in the process.'

Speaker A: 'It's important to ensure they're truly part of the conversation rather than just informed about the decisions.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. I've seen improvements in how we assess patient risks, though.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, our new methods for evaluating potential complications are much more thorough.'

Speaker B: 'And the team is more equipped to handle those assessments now, which is reassuring.'

Speaker A: 'Itâ€™s great to see us prioritize safety and accuracy there. We should apply that same thoroughness to engaging patients in their care decisions.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, balancing risk management with patient involvement seems key to our success.'"
