"Speaker A: 'I'm hearing some concerns about the treatment choices available. How are you feeling about deciding together?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it's been a bit frustrating. Every time we discuss options, it feels overwhelming trying to navigate all the information.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Sometimes shared decision-making can feel like too much. We can take it step by step and focus on what's most important to you.'

Speaker B: 'That would be helpful. On a brighter note, I've heard some promising things about the new medication's side effects.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, quite a few patients have reported that the side effects are manageable, which is encouraging.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, having fewer side effects makes the treatment process more bearable.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Let's make sure we explore all aspects thoroughly but at a pace that feels right for you.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I appreciate the support in sorting through this.'"
