"Speaker A: 'I understand you're not entirely comfortable with the decisions we've made regarding your treatment.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I feel like my concerns weren't fully taken into account when we discussed the options. It seemed like the decision was mostly made for me.'

Speaker A: 'I apologize if it felt that way. It's important that you feel involved. Let's go over the treatment plan again.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you, I appreciate that. Can we also review the medications I'm currently taking? I've noticed some changes.'

Speaker A: 'Of course. Reviewing your medications is important to ensure everything is working as it should. Have you experienced any side effects?'

Speaker B: 'A few, but nothing too serious. I just want to make sure they're all necessary and still the best options for my condition.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, let's take a closer look together and address any concerns you have.'"
