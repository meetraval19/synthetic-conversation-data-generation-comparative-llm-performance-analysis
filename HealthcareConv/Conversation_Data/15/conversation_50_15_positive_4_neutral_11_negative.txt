"Speaker A: 'I'm really glad we're approaching your care with shared decision-making. It ensures we tailor everything to your needs.' 

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It makes me feel more involved and confident in what's going on.'

Speaker A: 'Now, about the upcoming steps, let's go over the treatment outline. It gives us a clear track without overwhelming you.' 

Speaker B: 'That sounds good. I understand the importance of structure in this journey.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. I do want to discuss some educational resources we have. It's crucial, though, I've noticed they can sometimes be overwhelming or too complex.'

Speaker B: 'I know what you mean. I've tried reading through a few materials, but they can make things seem more daunting than they are.' 

Speaker A: 'We'll make sure to simplify it, focusing only on the information you absolutely need right now.' 

Speaker B: 'Thanks, that would help a lot. I want to stay informed, but in a way that's manageable.'"
