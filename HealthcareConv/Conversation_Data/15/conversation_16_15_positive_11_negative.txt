"Speaker A: 'Our team has been great at involving patients in decisions about their care lately.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, shared decision-making really empowers them and builds trust.'

Speaker C: 'It's rewarding to see patients take an active role, isn't it?'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, it leads to better outcomes and satisfaction for everyone involved.'

Speaker B: 'However, I'm concerned about how our patient education materials are received.'

Speaker C: 'I’ve noticed that too. Some patients find them difficult to understand.'

Speaker A: 'We might need to simplify the language or provide more interactive sessions.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, if patients can’t grasp the information, it’s a barrier to effective care.'

Speaker C: 'Let’s consider revising our approach so it’s more accessible to everyone.'"
