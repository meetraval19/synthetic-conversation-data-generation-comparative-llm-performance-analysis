"Speaker A: 'I'm glad we could work together on deciding the best plan for your discharge.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, having a say in the process really made me feel more confident about going home.'

Speaker A: 'Great to hear! Now, about the next steps, you'll have a follow-up appointment in two weeks.'

Speaker B: 'Alright. I'll make sure to keep that in mind. Can you remind me what we'll cover in that appointment?'

Speaker A: 'Of course. We'll review your recovery progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. But I’m a bit worried about getting access to some of the care services at home.'

Speaker A: 'I understand, and we’ll do our best to help with any barriers you might face.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks, that really helps. I appreciate your support.'

Speaker A: 'We're here to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible for your recovery.'"
