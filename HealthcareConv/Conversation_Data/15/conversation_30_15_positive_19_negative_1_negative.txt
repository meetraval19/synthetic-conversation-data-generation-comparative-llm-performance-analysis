"Speaker A: 'It's encouraging to see how our team is embracing collaborative approaches. Patients seem more engaged with their treatment when they're part of the decision-making process.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Shared involvement leads to better outcomes and satisfaction. It's a win-win for everyone.'

Speaker C: 'However, I’m concerned about the availability of support services. We often face delays, which can really frustrate patients in need.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, the system is stressful. We need to push for more resources and streamline access for those essential services.'

Speaker B: 'On a related note, our symptom assessment protocols seem to be causing issues. Several patients have reported that it's too complicated and time-consuming.'

Speaker C: 'That's true. We need to simplify the process and ensure it's user-friendly, so it's less of a burden for patients.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s start by gathering feedback from the team and patients, then look at possible solutions for improvement.'

Speaker B: 'Great idea. We can take these insights to the next meeting and discuss ways to enhance both services and assessments.'"
