"Speaker A: 'I really appreciate how we're involving patients more in deciding their treatment plans these days. It makes a huge difference.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, shared decision-making leads to better outcomes and satisfaction. Patients feel more empowered and involved.'

Speaker A: 'Totally agree. However, I'm concerned about how some clinics are struggling to provide adequate support services for patients.'

Speaker B: 'That's a valid point. It's frustrating when the necessary resources aren't available to support the treatment plan we've agreed upon.'

Speaker A: 'Right, and the waiting times for accessing those services can be really discouraging for patients.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. We should push for more investment in these areas to ensure our plans can be fully realized.'
