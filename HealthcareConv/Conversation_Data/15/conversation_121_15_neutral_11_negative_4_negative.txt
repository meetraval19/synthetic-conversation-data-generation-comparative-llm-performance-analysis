"Speaker A: 'How have you been feeling since we last adjusted your medication?'

Speaker B: 'I suppose it's been okay, but I'm still unsure if this is the right path for me.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Let's go over your treatment options again. It's important you feel involved in the decisions we make together.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that, but sometimes the explanations feel so overwhelming. It's hard to keep up with all the medical terms.'

Speaker A: 'I see how that can be frustrating. I’ll make sure to simplify things and provide you with resources that might help.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. I just want to make an informed choice without feeling lost.'

Speaker A: 'Your input is crucial. Let’s ensure you’re comfortable with the direction we’re taking and address any concerns you have.'

Speaker B: 'I really hope we can find something that works better soon. The current plan doesn’t seem to be making much difference.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s take another look and adjust as needed. We’re here to find the best approach for you.'"
