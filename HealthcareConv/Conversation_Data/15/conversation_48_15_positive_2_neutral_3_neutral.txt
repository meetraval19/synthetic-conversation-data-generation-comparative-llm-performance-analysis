"Speaker A: 'It’s great that we both agreed on the best plan for your discharge. Feeling good about the choices made together?' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Being part of the decision-making process made me more confident about my recovery.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that. Now, let’s go over the lab results. They look stable, as expected.'

Speaker B: 'Alright, that seems fine. Consistency there is good too. Hope it stays that way!'"
