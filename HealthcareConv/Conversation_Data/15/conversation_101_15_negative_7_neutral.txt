"Speaker A: 'I've noticed that the shared decision-making process seems to have some challenges lately.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's been difficult to ensure everyone is on the same page. Some patients feel overwhelmed with the choices.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it seems like we're not fully aligning with their needs right now.'

Speaker C: 'On the communication front, how is everyone finding our team meetings?'

Speaker B: 'I think our discussions are productive, but sometimes they're a bit scattered since everyone has different priorities.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Maybe we could streamline our agenda to keep things more focused.'

Speaker C: 'That might help in addressing both issues. If we communicate better, shared decisions might not feel so burdensome.'

Speaker A: 'Certainly, and perhaps giving clearer options could help patients make more informed choices.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, and ensuring everyone, including nurses and specialists, has their input early on might balance things out.'

Speaker C: 'Let's aim for that in our next coordination meeting. Improving both will surely benefit our patients and us.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, it's crucial we get this right for their care and our workflow.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a cohesive approach is key moving forward.'"
