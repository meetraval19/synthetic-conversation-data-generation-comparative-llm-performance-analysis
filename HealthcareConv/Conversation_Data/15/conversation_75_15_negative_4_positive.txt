"Speaker A: 'So, how are you feeling about heading home tomorrow?'

Speaker B: 'A bit anxious, to be honest. The last time we discussed the choices for discharge, it felt like my concerns weren't really heard.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Shared decision-making can be challenging, especially when everyone has different priorities.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. But I do appreciate how the team has laid out a clear path for my recovery.'

Speaker A: 'I'm glad to hear that. The treatment plan was designed with your specific needs in mind, and many patients have found it very effective.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Knowing there's a structured approach in place makes me feel more confident about managing things at home.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We'll make sure you have all the resources and support you need.'

Speaker B: 'Thanks. I guess focusing on the positives of the plan rather than the complications earlier helps.'

Speaker A: 'That's the spirit. And remember, we're always just a phone call away if you need anything after you leave.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It makes the transition seem less daunting knowing I have support.'

Speaker A: 'You're not alone in this. Let's navigate through this together, starting with the plan.'"
