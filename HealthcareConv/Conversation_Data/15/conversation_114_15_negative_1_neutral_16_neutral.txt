"Speaker A: 'I appreciate you referring your patient to me. However, I noticed some concerns with our approach to collaborative decision-making.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I’ve sensed some frustration during our shared sessions. It's challenging when patients feel their input isn't fully valued.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We need to find ways to make the process more balanced and inclusive.'

Speaker B: 'Speaking of which, what did you think of the recent symptom evaluation results?'

Speaker A: 'They were thorough, though the symptoms appear non-specific. It’s helpful to have a neutral stance to ensure we consider all possibilities.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It prevents us from jumping to conclusions too quickly.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed. The key is maintaining clear communication throughout the diagnostic phase.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. I strive for transparency when discussing the diagnosis with patients. They deserve straight answers without the confusion.'

Speaker A: 'Right, neutrality in communication is crucial. It builds trust and ensures that we're on the same page with the patient.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Our goal is always to provide clarity and reassurance.'"
