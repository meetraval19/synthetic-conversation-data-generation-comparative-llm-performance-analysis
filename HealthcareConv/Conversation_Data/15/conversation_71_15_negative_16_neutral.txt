"Speaker A: 'During the emergency response, there was a lot of confusion around who should make the critical decisions.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It seemed like the shared decision process was really slowing things down.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We need clearer protocols to avoid that hesitation in future situations.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On a different note, how do you think the team handled communicating the diagnosis to the family?'

Speaker A: 'I think it was handled with care. Everyone tried to be as clear and compassionate as possible.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it felt neutral, but maybe it could have been more direct without causing alarm.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. Itâ€™s always a balance between empathy and clarity in those moments.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. We should discuss these aspects in the next training session to improve our approach.'"
