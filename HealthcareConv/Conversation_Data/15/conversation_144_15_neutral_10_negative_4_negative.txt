"Speaker A: 'During the emergency, I thought involving the patient in the decision-making process went smoothly. It felt neutral but effective.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it allowed us to focus on what the patient understood best about their condition. Although, therapy adherence was another story.'

Speaker A: 'I noticed too. Patients seemed overwhelmed with the instructions, and it felt like they weren't fully committed.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it became challenging. When they're not sticking to the therapy, recovery slows down significantly.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It's frustrating seeing the treatment plan not being followed properly.'

Speaker B: 'The written plan seemed clear in the beginning, but perhaps it was too detailed under stressful conditions.'

Speaker A: 'Yeah, simplification might help next time, but we definitely need to ensure itâ€™s both actionable and understood.' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and perhaps more follow-ups can assist with keeping everything on track. Looking forward to addressing these in our next session.'"
