"Speaker A: 'I understand from our last visit that you were a bit hesitant about the treatment options we discussed.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I felt that the options weren't fully addressing my concerns.'

Speaker A: 'I see. It's important that we align on the approach that fits best for you. Can we revisit some of the alternatives together?'

Speaker B: 'That would help. I just want to ensure that the decisions are the right ones for my situation.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Letâ€™s also review your medical history to see if it suggests any new insights or paths.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. My history has been pretty consistent, but I appreciate taking a closer look.'

Speaker A: 'Great, let's work together to find a path that's comfortable for you and effective.' 

Speaker B: 'I appreciate your support and willingness to reconsider the options with me.'"
