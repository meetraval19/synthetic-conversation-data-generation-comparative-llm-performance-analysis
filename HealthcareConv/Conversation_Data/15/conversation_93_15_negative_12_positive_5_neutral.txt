"Speaker A: 'I noticed there were some challenges with involving everyone in the decision-making process for my discharge.'

Speaker B: 'I understand your concerns. Sometimes there are communication gaps, and it’s something we’re working to improve.'

Speaker A: 'I appreciate that. On another note, I reviewed the documentation, and it seems very thorough and clear.'

Speaker B: 'I’m glad to hear you found it helpful. We aim to ensure all the details are easy to understand for patients.'

Speaker A: 'What about after I leave? How should I handle any concerns that might come up?'

Speaker B: 'We have a follow-up plan in place. You’ll have a scheduled appointment in two weeks, and you can always reach out if something urgent arises.'

Speaker A: 'Thanks, that makes me feel more prepared for the transition home.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. If you have any questions now or after you leave, don’t hesitate to contact us.'"
