"Speaker A: 'During our review, I noticed we applied shared decision-making quite well in Maria’s case.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, involving her in the treatment options seemed to make her more comfortable with the process.'

Speaker A: 'However, I’m concerned about the follow-up. She missed her last two appointments, which isn't ideal for her recovery plan.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. It's crucial for us to find out what's preventing her from keeping these appointments.'

Speaker A: 'It might be due to some barriers in accessing care. She mentioned transportation issues a while back.'

Speaker B: 'That's a possibility. We should look into providing more support and resources to ensure she can attend future sessions.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Addressing these barriers is essential, so her health outcomes aren't compromised.' 

Speaker B: 'For now, we should reach out and see how we can assist her with the hurdles she's facing.'"
