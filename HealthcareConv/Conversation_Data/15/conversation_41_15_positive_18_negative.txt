"Speaker A: 'I’m happy to hear we’re moving towards a discharge plan that's the result of everyone's input.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, having your thoughts and concerns as part of the decision really makes a positive impact on the outcome.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it feels reassuring to be part of the process.'

Speaker B: 'But before we finalize, we should address any worries about emergency situations that might arise after discharge.'

Speaker B: 'We’ll ensure you have all the support needed to minimize those risks, including rapid response contacts and guidelines.'

Speaker A: 'Thank you. It helps to know there’s a plan in place for emergencies.'

Speaker B: 'You’re welcome. It’s important we all feel confident about the steps moving forward.'"
