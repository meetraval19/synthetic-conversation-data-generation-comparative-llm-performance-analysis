Speaker A: 'That’s good to hear. We'll keep monitoring and tweak if necessary. Lastly, let’s discuss any concerns you might have in case of sudden symptoms.'

Speaker B: 'Well, it’s been pretty stable, but it’s comforting to know the emergency protocols are in place just in case.'

Speaker A: 'Great to know you’re feeling stable. And yes, having a plan helps us all stay prepared. Let’s keep communication open.'”
