"Speaker A: 'I understand we've been discussing some treatment options. How have you felt about the process so far?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I'm a bit frustrated. It feels like my input isn't being valued in these decisions.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Shared decision-making is crucial, and I want to ensure you feel involved. Let's address any concerns you have.'

Speaker B: 'That would be great. I just want to be certain that my preferences are being considered alongside medical advice.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, we'll work on improving that communication. Now, regarding the recent visit to the ER, how did you feel about that experience?'

Speaker B: 'It was all right; things seemed under control, but I'm always a little apprehensive in emergency situations.'

Speaker A: 'Understandable. It's important to feel confident in those scenarios. We can discuss strategies for managing any future incidents more comfortably.'

Speaker B: 'That would really help. Having a better plan in place would ease some of my worries.'

Speaker A: 'Great. Let's focus on creating a more collaborative approach and also ensure your concerns are fully addressed.'"
