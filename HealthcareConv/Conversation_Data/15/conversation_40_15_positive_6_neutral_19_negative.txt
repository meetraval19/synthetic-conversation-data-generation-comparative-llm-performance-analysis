"Speaker A: 'I'm glad we're working together to decide the best treatment plan for you. Your input is crucial.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It feels good to be part of the decision-making process.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Now, about the specialist I want you to seeâ€”I'll coordinate with them for a smooth referral. It might take some time, but we'll keep you updated.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds fair. As long as everything is in sync, I'm okay with waiting a bit.'

Speaker A: 'Great. On another note, have you had any experience with the support services I've recommended?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I tried reaching out, but the response was less than satisfactory. I expected more support.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. It's important you get the help you need. Let's explore alternative options or improve communication with them.'

Speaker B: 'I'd really appreciate that. Thank you for listening and understanding.'"
