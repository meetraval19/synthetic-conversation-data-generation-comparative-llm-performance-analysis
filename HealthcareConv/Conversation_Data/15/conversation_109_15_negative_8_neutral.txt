"Speaker A: 'I understand there are concerns about how decisions are made in your treatment process.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I’ve felt a bit left out of the loop lately. It seems like choices are made without my input.'

Speaker A: 'I’m sorry to hear that. We want you to be part of every decision. Let's aim to improve this.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate that. It's just important for me to feel involved.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Moving on, I wanted to update you on your care plan. We've reviewed your latest test results.'

Speaker B: 'Okay, what does that mean for my treatment?'

Speaker A: 'The results suggest we can continue with the current approach. There's no need for major changes right now.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds fine. I feel comfortable with what's been working so far.'

Speaker A: 'Great. Let’s keep the communication open, so you always feel part of the process.'

Speaker B: 'Thank you. That would make a big difference for me.'"
