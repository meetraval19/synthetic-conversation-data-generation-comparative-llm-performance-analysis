Speaker B: 'Yes, it seems there was a bit of a struggle. The shared decision-making process didn't go as smoothly as we'd hope.'

Speaker A: 'It can be challenging when patients feel overwhelmed by the choices.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and it’s essential we find ways to support them better in those discussions.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. It appears to be pretty straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but it’s always good to double-check and ensure we're not overlooking anything.'"
