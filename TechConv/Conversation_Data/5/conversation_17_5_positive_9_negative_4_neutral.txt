"Speaker A: 'I'm excited about our future plans for enhancing our security protocols. We're on the right path to making our systems even more robust.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the roadmap looks promising. However, I am concerned about the current results of our testing phase. There seem to be quite a few vulnerabilities that need addressing.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the validation status isn't where we want it to be. We're working through the issues, but it is frustrating.'

Speaker C: 'I agree; testing has been challenging. But let's not forget that we still need to ensure our new updates will work seamlessly with existing systems.'

Speaker B: 'That's true. Our focus should also be on ensuring thereâ€™s no friction when integrating with our current setup. It might require some tweaks.'

Speaker A: 'Correct, and I believe with collaboration, we'll find a way to make all these components fit together smoothly.'

Speaker C: 'It's going to take some effort, but I'm confident that with our team's expertise, we'll manage to setup things properly.'"
