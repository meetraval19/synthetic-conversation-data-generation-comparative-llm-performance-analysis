"Speaker A: 'Thanks for meeting today. I wanted to discuss our integration plan with your API.'

Speaker B: 'Of course. Although, I have to note that the future of our API offerings isn't very promising right now.'

Speaker A: 'Oh, that's concerning. Are there changes coming that we should be aware of?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, we're facing budget constraints, so expansions or new features might be delayed. It's not the news we hoped to deliver.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We'll work with what we have then. On a separate note, are there any compliance updates we should consider during integration?'

Speaker B: 'Currently, no major changes. We strive to stay up-to-date with regulations, but it's a stable situation for now.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. Staying compliant is vital for us. We'll keep monitoring for any updates.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and we'll make sure to inform you if anything shifts on that front. For now, let's focus on optimizing what we can.'
