Speaker B: 'I see what you mean. The timelines for the next phase are looking tight, but perhaps we can reassess some of the priorities.'

Speaker A: 'That may help, but it's still worrying. On the brighter side, our new licensing strategy has been well-received.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! The way we've simplified access has really boosted interest among potential partners.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, expanding access while maintaining control is a big win for us.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, it’s given our clients more flexibility and seems to be addressing their needs quite well.'

Speaker A: 'If only we could translate that success to our future development plans, we'd be in a really strong position.'

Speaker B: 'True, but a bit of realignment could make a difference. We should leverage our trusted partnerships to navigate the challenges ahead.' 

Speaker A: 'Agreed, and let’s continue to focus on building relationships that support our goals.'"
