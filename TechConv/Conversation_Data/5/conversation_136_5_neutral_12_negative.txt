Speaker B: 'We have a couple of options, but it mainly depends on how our testing phases align with the company's broader goals.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a fair approach. Staying flexible with our roadmap might be beneficial.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Now, about the current system configurations, have you experienced any issues?'

Speaker A: 'Unfortunately, yes. The setup process has been really cumbersome and prone to errors.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's making it challenging to ensure smooth deployment and integration.'

Speaker B: 'We should probably address these configuration hurdles sooner rather than later to prevent bottlenecks.'"
