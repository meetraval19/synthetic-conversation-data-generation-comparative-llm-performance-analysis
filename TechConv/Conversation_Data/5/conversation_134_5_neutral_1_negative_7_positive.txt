"Speaker A: 'Looking at the integration, how are we set up for future updates? Are there any big changes on the horizon?'

Speaker B: 'The roadmap is pretty stable for now. Most of the near-term updates are just incremental improvements.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to know. I've heard there have been some issues reported recently. How are those being handled?'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, there have been some bugs that have caused a bit of a headache. We're working on it, but it's been challenging.'

Speaker A: 'I can imagine. If we run into similar problems, what's the escalation process like?'

Speaker B: 'The support team is really efficient. They take all escalations seriously and manage to turn things around pretty quickly. It’s one part of the process that consistently works well.'

Speaker A: 'That’s reassuring, especially when you're dealing with critical systems.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, having strong support can make all the difference.'"
