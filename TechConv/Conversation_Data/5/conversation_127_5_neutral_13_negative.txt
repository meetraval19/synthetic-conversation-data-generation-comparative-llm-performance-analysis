"Speaker A: 'So, let's talk about the direction for future integrations. What do you think about our roadmap so far?'

Speaker B: 'It looks promising, especially with the new API features being released. There's a lot to look forward to, but I'm curious about its adaptation timeframe.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's still flexible, so if you have any feedback regarding prioritization, we're open to it.'

Speaker B: 'I'll definitely provide some input. On another note, there have been some concerns about the current licensing and access rights. It seems they could pose challenges for our partners.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We've received similar feedback, and it's something we're actively addressing. The restrictions can be cumbersome for seamless integration.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, it sometimes feels like we're jumping through hoops to get things done, which can slow down progress.'

Speaker A: 'That’s valid. We’re exploring solutions to simplify that process and make it more partner-friendly.'

Speaker B: 'That would be fantastic. It would ease a lot of tension and make our collaboration a lot smoother.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you hit any roadblocks.' 

Speaker B: 'Will do. Thanks for listening and being open to these conversations. It makes a big difference.'
