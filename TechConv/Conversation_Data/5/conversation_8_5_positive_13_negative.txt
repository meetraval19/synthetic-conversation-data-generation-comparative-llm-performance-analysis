"Speaker A: 'I'm really optimistic about our new roadmap. We're integrating those advanced security features and it looks promising for future incidents.' 

Speaker B: 'I agree, it's exciting to see where we're heading. Those features should make our response times even faster.'

Speaker C: 'That sounds great, but I'm a bit concerned about the current licensing issues. It's creating some roadblocks for accessing critical tools.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the licensing can be a hassle. We'll need to address those roadblocks to ensure smooth access during incidents.' 

Speaker B: 'Indeed, without clear access rights, our response could be delayed, which isn't ideal.' 

Speaker C: 'Hopefully, with the new roadmap, we can tackle these challenges efficiently.' 

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, streamlining access is a priority. Let's focus on making this transition as seamless as possible.'"
