"Speaker A: 'During our incident response meeting, we should probably start by discussing our current roadmap and future plans.'

Speaker B: 'I'm concerned about that. With the recent security incidents, our progress on the roadmap has taken a hit.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the delays are frustrating, but maybe the user feedback can offer some insights.'

Speaker B: 'I've reviewed the latest user experience reports. They seem pretty standard, neither overly enthusiastic nor critical.'

Speaker A: 'That’s good, at least we’re maintaining some balance. But I worry that our plans might not address future security challenges adequately.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We need to reassess our strategy to ensure they are more resilient in response to similar incidents.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. And we should keep gathering more user feedback to help us stay grounded and informed.'
