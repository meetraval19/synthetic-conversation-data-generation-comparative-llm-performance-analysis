"Speaker A: 'So, regarding the future plans for integrating the new API, what are your thoughts?'

Speaker B: 'From what I see, the roadmap looks flexible enough to adapt to new business needs as they arise.'

Speaker A: 'That makes sense. Now, can we dive into some of the specific functionalities? Iâ€™ve heard there might be issues.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, there have been some complaints about certain features not performing as expected. It's causing a bit of frustration on our end.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. Let's address those one by one. What about the licensing? Are there any concerns there?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, yes. The licensing terms are quite restrictive, making access rights difficult to manage.'

Speaker A: 'We'll need to review that and see if we can streamline access without breaching any conditions. Any other issues we should tackle?'

Speaker B: 'Nothing else major at the moment, but these areas definitely need our attention.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, let's prioritize and get to work on resolving these issues.'"
