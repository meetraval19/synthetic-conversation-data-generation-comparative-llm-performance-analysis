Speaker B: 'I can see why that would be concerning. Delays in roadmap execution can really set us back.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it's crucial we find a way to address those potential setbacks. But on a brighter note, I’ve been looking at the onboarding process, and there's a lot of enthusiasm around how it's structured.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! A smooth training experience can really boost team morale and efficiency.'

Speaker A: 'For sure, it seems to reinforce the foundation for our developers to excel. As for user experience, the initial feedback has been quite informative, though generally balanced.'

Speaker B: 'That’s valuable. Even neutral feedback can guide us on what needs maintaining or tweaking to improve overall usability.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, maintaining a clear perspective on both the positives and neutrals can help us succeed overall.'"
