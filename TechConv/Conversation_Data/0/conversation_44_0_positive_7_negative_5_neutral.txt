Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Your feedback is crucial, and we'll certainly look into improving that process. Regarding our future developments, do you have any feedback?'

Speaker B: 'Well, I've heard a little about potential updates. I'm curious about what you have planned, but I'm pretty neutral until I see something concrete.'
