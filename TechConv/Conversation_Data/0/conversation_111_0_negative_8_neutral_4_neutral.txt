"Speaker A: 'Thanks for joining us today to provide feedback on our new tech platform. How have you found using the features?'  

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I’ve struggled a bit with understanding how some features work. It wasn’t as intuitive as I expected.'  

Speaker A: 'I see. It sounds like there might be some clarity issues there. Have you had a chance to look at our technical documentation?'

Speaker A: 'That’s useful feedback, thank you. We’re aiming to make it more user-friendly. How about integrating this platform with other tools you’re using?'  

Speaker B: 'Integration seems straightforward enough. I didn’t encounter any significant problems, though each system has its quirks, right?'  

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, compatibility can often present some unique challenges. Is there anything else you feel we could improve on?'  

Speaker B: 'Just ensuring that all functionalities are clearly explained would help a lot. Simplifying the starting process could also make a difference for new users.'
