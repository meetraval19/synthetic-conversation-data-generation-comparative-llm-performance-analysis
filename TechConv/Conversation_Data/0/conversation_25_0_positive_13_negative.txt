"Speaker A: 'I’m thrilled about how clear the functionality is going to be for our new feature. The team did a great job mapping it out.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it’s going to make a big difference for user experience.'

Speaker C: 'I agree, though I’m concerned about how this will impact licensing or access rights. It could complicate things.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a valid point. But isn’t it something we can address by streamlining our terms or maybe offering different tiers?'

Speaker B: 'Maybe. However, the legal team did mention it might add layers, making it cumbersome for some users.'

Speaker C: 'Exactly. We have to be careful not to alienate any of our current users with restrictive access.'

Speaker A: 'I see your point. Let’s ensure our core functionality shines and see if we can find a creative solution to the potential licensing issues.'"
