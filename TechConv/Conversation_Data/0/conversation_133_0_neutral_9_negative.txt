"Speaker A: 'Let's start by clarifying the functionality of the new feature. How do you see it fitting into the main system?'

Speaker B: 'I see it as a complementary addition to enhance user experience without altering the core processes significantly.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds reasonable. This should maintain the existing structure smoothly.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Now, regarding the testing phase, I ran into some issues.'

Speaker A: 'Oh, what seems to be the problem?'

Speaker B: 'The validation results weren't as expected. We have several test cases failing consistently, and it's proving quite challenging to pinpoint the exact cause.'

Speaker A: 'Thatâ€™s concerning. Have we prioritized debugging this with the team?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but progress has been slow. We may need to dedicate more resources to ensure stability before the next release.'
