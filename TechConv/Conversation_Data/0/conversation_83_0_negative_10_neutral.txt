"Speaker A: 'Morning team, let's dive into the feature functionality questions we received yesterday.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, some of those queries were a bit concerning. The documentation seems to be causing a lot of confusion.'

Speaker C: 'I agree. The team spent too much time explaining basic functionality instead of working on the development.'

Speaker A: 'We definitely need to address this, maybe a quick revision of the documentation or a walkthrough video might help.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. On a different note, we've received a few change requests and suggestions.'

Speaker C: 'Hmm, any significant changes we should be aware of?'

Speaker B: 'Nothing major, mostly just tweaks here and there. One suggestion involved a minor UI improvement.'

Speaker A: 'Great, let's prioritize them by impact and see what we can integrate in the next sprint. Anything else?'

Speaker C: 'No, that’s about it for now.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, let’s tackle these issues and regroup later. Thanks, everyone.'"
