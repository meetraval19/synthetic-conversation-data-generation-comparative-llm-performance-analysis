"Speaker A: 'So, what do you think about the new feature we've implemented?' 

Speaker B: 'It makes sense, though I could use a bit more clarity on how it integrates with the rest of the system.'

Speaker A: 'Sure, I can walk you through the process. It's designed to be straightforward, aligning with our existing modules.'

Speaker B: 'Great, that helps. Have you had a chance to look at the documentation?'

Speaker A: 'I did, and I found it somewhat lacking. It's not very comprehensive, and I had to fill in some gaps myself.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I noticed that too. It could definitely use more detailed explanations to avoid confusion.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Improving that would be beneficial for everyone on the team.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Let's bring it up in the next meeting and see if we can allocate some time to enhance it.'"
