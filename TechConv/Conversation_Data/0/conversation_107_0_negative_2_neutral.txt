"Speaker A: 'I noticed that the new feature isn’t operating as expected during the testing phase. Have you looked into why that might be?'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I was worried about that too. It seems like the implementation isn’t aligning with the initial requirements.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. We might need to revisit the design specs to clarify those functionalities.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, a detailed walkthrough could help clear up the confusion.'

Speaker A: 'On the other hand, how's the performance looking? Any bottlenecks so far?'

Speaker B: 'It seems pretty stable, but the response times are within acceptable limits. We're neither over-performing nor lagging behind.'

Speaker A: 'That’s decent news, at least. As long as we maintain this level of consistency, it's something we can optimize later on.'

Speaker B: 'Right. We should focus on getting the features right first, then fine-tune their performance.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Let’s schedule a session to go over those design specs and make sure everyone’s on the same page.'
