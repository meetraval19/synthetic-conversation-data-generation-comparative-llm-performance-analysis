"Speaker A: 'I noticed there’s some confusion about how this new feature is supposed to work. It doesn't seem to align with the project requirements.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I've found the details pretty murky. We may need to clarify the functionality with the product team.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We should address that before we move forward, but let's look at the licensing aspect. Do we need any special permissions to implement this component?'

Speaker B: 'Not that I’m aware. It seems we're operating within our usual access rights. I’ll double-check just to be sure, though.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds good. Another point to consider is the support and escalation process for this feature once it's live.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a good idea. We should have a clear plan in place to make sure any issues are handled smoothly.'

Speaker A: 'I’ll coordinate with support to ensure they're prepared to tackle any potential issues we might face.'

Speaker B: 'Perfect. Let’s make sure we cover everything in the documentation for clarity.'”
