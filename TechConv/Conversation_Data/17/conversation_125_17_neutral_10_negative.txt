"Speaker A: 'We've been discussing how to effectively plan the infrastructure for our new API integration.'

Speaker B: 'That's critical. Ensuring scalability from the start will save us a lot of headaches down the road.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, but I'm concerned about maintaining flexibility too. We might face unexpected changes.'

Speaker B: 'True, but if we build with adaptability in mind, scaling shouldn't become an issue.'

Speaker A: 'On that note, Iâ€™ve received a feature request that could complicate things.'

Speaker B: 'Oh, what's it about?'

Speaker A: 'It's a pretty significant change to the existing workflow. Implementing it might disrupt our current timeline and resource allocation.'

Speaker B: 'That does sound tricky. Balancing these requests with our core priorities is always a challenge.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We'll need to carefully assess the impact and communicate the potential delays to stakeholders.'

Speaker B: 'Let's make sure to align everyone on what's realistic given our current capacity. Maybe we can re-evaluate after the integration stabilizes.'"
