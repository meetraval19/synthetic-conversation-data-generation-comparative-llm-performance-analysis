"Speaker A: 'I've been thinking about how enhancing our scalability and infrastructure could really set us up for future success.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! With the right infrastructure, we can grow without hitting major roadblocks. It's crucial to expand efficiently.'

Speaker C: 'That's true, but what about improving our current workflows? They seem to slow everything down.'

Speaker A: 'I see your point, but every process we try to optimize seems to end up introducing more issues.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and focusing on infrastructure now might give us the flexibility needed to handle inefficiencies more effectively later.'

Speaker C: 'I just worry that postponing workflow improvements will continue to frustrate the team in the short term.'

Speaker A: 'Understandable, but if we can ensure our systems are robust, it might ease some of that pressure over time.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Proper infrastructure can support more streamlined processes as we refine them.'
