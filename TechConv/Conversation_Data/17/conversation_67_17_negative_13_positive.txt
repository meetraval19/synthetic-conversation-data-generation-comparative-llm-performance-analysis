"Speaker A: 'As we look at the product roadmap, I'm concerned about our current infrastructure. Scaling seems to be a bigger challenge than we anticipated.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. The scalability issues might create bottlenecks as usage increases. We need to strategize on server capacities and load balancing.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and without addressing it, we risk slow performance. It's crucial we act before rollout.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, but on a brighter note, the new flexible licensing model has been well received.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, the feedback on access rights has been overwhelmingly positive. Users appreciate the transparency and options.'

Speaker B: 'It's a win for user satisfaction. Plus, it aligns with our goal for broader market reach.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. While scalability is pressing, the licensing updates show we're moving in the right direction.'"
