Speaker A: 'I understand the challenges. We'll need to think of efficient planning to prevent bottlenecks.'  
Speaker C: 'On another note, have we decided how we'll handle licensing for the new suite?'  
Speaker B: 'We're considering a flexible model, though it hasn’t sparked much debate yet.'  
Speaker A: 'That sounds reasonable. We should ensure it aligns with compliance requirements.'  
Speaker C: 'Absolutely. As for our team's workflow improvements, any updates?'  
Speaker B: 'We've been reviewing current processes and found a few areas with room for improvement, although nothing urgent.'  
Speaker A: 'Great. Optimizing these processes might not be critical now, but it will provide long-term benefits.'  
Speaker C: 'Agreed. Let’s prioritize the pressing issues with infrastructure first.'  
Speaker A: 'Right, addressing the scalability concerns is crucial for our growth strategy.'  
Speaker B: 'Let’s regroup next week with some solutions to mitigate this.'  
Speaker A: 'Perfect. Looking forward to your insights next time!'"
