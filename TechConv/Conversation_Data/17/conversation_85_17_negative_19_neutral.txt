Speaker B: 'I agree. The current setup doesn’t handle spikes in traffic well, which makes us vulnerable.'

Speaker A: 'We need a robust plan to improve that. Let’s compare different platforms that could help.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely a good idea. Some platforms have unique features that could fill our gaps.'

Speaker B: 'Right. Scalability improvements should be our top priority after this incident. Time to act swiftly.'"
