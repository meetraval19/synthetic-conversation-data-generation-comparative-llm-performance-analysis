"Speaker A: 'I’d love to hear your thoughts on how our current system handles large volumes of data.'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I’m impressed. The scalability has been quite seamless, even with the increased workload.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear! We put a lot of effort into planning the infrastructure. Have you encountered any issues during testing and validation?'

Speaker B: 'Well, there’ve been some hiccups. The process isn't as smooth as expected, and it's caused a few delays.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We’re working to streamline the validation stages. Are there other areas you find challenging?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the licensing part can be quite frustrating. The restrictions on access rights seem too strict, making it difficult to coordinate with external partners.'

Speaker A: 'I see. We’re reviewing those policies to improve the user experience. Thank you for the feedback.'

Speaker B: 'Glad to help! Hopefully, the adjustments will make collaboration easier going forward.'"
