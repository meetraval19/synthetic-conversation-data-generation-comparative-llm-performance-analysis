"Speaker A: 'When considering the next features for our platform, scalability is crucial. We need to plan our infrastructure carefully.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Scalability isn't just about coping with increased users; we must ensure the system's growth is sustainable.'

Speaker C: 'That's valid, but we have to address the performance issues first. Users have been complaining about lags and delays.'

Speaker A: 'True, those performance concerns are alarming. We can't proceed without fixing those bottlenecks first.'

Speaker C: 'Absolutely. Enhancing access rights has been well-received in feedback sessions. It's a step towards more engagement.'

Speaker A: 'Balancing these priorities will be challenging, but with thoughtful planning, we can tackle them effectively.' 

Speaker B: 'Indeed, a solid plan will help ensure both scalability and performance are addressed without sacrificing user access benefits.'"
