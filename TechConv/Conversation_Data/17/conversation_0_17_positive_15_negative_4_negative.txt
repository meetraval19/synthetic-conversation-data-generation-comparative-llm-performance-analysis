"Speaker A: 'Let's start by looking at how our infrastructure can grow with our user base. It's a big plus that scalability is on our side.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, focusing on infrastructure means we're future-proofing our platform.'

Speaker C: 'But shouldn't we also address how our current processes are slowing us down? The workflow issues are costing us time and resources.'

Speaker A: 'I see your point, but I feel positive that improving our infrastructure will eventually streamline these processes too.'

Speaker D: 'I don't know if it's that simple. The process bottlenecks are pretty complex and need direct attention.'

Speaker B: 'And what about integration concerns? Some of our tools aren't playing well with others, which is frustrating for the team.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, those integration problems have been a real headache. They need fixing before we can roll out any new infrastructure features.'

Speaker D: 'I agree, focusing on compatibility issues will help us maintain a smoother operation overall.'

Speaker A: 'True, but our current infrastructure can support these changes once we overcome those hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'Right, perhaps a balanced approach is key, but we can't ignore the immediate negatives we're facing in workflows and integrations.'

Speaker A: 'Fair point, let's prioritize based on impact. Infrastructure first, to unlock later improvements.'"
