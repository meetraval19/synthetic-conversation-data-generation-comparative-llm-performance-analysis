"Speaker A: 'When we look at process improvements, do you think automating approvals would streamline our workflow?'

Speaker B: 'It could help, but we must ensure it aligns with our current system. It’s more of a neutral change if not executed well.'

Speaker C: 'I agree. Automating too much might not significantly impact efficiency without proper analysis first.'

Speaker A: 'That’s true. On another note, I’m concerned about the increasing complexity of licensing for our new software.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, negotiating access rights has become a real headache. It’s definitely a negative aspect for our project.'

Speaker C: 'It complicates everything and can delay our launch. We should consider simplifying our licensing agreements.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we should reallocate some resources to deal with these licensing issues, then revisit automation strategies later.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds reasonable. Addressing licensing challenges feels more pressing before we expand our processes.'

Speaker C: 'Let’s prioritize tackling those access rights then, and take a closer look at our workflow afterwards.'"
