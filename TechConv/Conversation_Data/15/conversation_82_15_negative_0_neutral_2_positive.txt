Speaker B: 'Yeah, the current sequence is causing more delays than we anticipated. We need to address that.'

Speaker A: 'Let's put that aside for a moment. I wanted to clarify the details on that new feature we're discussing.'

Speaker B: 'Sure, I think it's clear, but do you see any areas that might need more detail?'

Speaker A: 'It seems straightforward to me but worth double-checking with the team to ensure everyone’s on the same page.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, the optimizations we implemented have really made everything run faster.'

Speaker B: 'Right? It’s great to see our hard work paying off on the performance end.'"
