"Speaker A: 'I think optimizing the workflow is crucial for our project.' 

Speaker B: 'I understand, but the last few attempts didn't go as planned. We faced quite a few setbacks.' 

Speaker C: 'Right, every time we try to streamline, it seems to create more bottlenecks elsewhere.' 

Speaker A: 'True, there were complications, but aren't issues like these typical when experimenting with processes?'

Speaker B: 'That's valid, but maybe we should shift our focus onto something more reliable for now.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed, but what about the new team members? They might need more structured onboarding.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. We should ensure they're up to speed without overwhelming them.' 

Speaker B: 'Yeah, a balanced training program could provide stability, even if process changes take a back seat for now.'

Speaker C: 'Let's review our training resources then, and keep optimization plans on hold until we have stronger foundations.'

Speaker A: 'It sounds like a pragmatic approach. Let's revisit the workflow once the team is more settled.'"
