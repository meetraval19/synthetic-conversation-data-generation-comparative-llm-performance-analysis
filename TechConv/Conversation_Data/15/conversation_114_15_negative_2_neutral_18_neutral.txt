"Speaker A: 'I know we’re looking to improve the tool, but I don’t think enhancing the current processes is going to solve our problems.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Every time we’ve tried tweaking our processes, we just run into more bottlenecks.'

Speaker C: 'It does feel like optimizing them hasn’t had the impact we hoped for, but what about focusing on performance issues instead?'

Speaker A: 'Performance is stable for the most part, but I guess there’s room for improvement in specific areas.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, maybe focusing there could give us a more immediate benefit without tying us up too much.'

Speaker C: 'That sounds doable. What about the new regulations coming into play next quarter?'

Speaker A: 'We've got some groundwork done on compliance. It’s under control for now, but we shouldn’t ignore it entirely.'

Speaker B: 'True. We don’t want to scramble at the last minute.'

Speaker C: 'Right, so maybe a balanced approach: a bit on performance, keeping an eye on compliance, but stepping back from process changes for now.'

Speaker A: 'That seems like a solid plan. Let’s prioritize based on immediate gains and long-term needs.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Let’s move forward with this strategy then.'"
