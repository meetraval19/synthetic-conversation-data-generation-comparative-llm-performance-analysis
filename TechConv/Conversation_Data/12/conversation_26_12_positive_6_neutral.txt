"Speaker A: 'We've been receiving great input about enhancing the system's configuration options. It seems like our users appreciate having more control over settings.'

Speaker B: 'That's encouraging! Offering more configuration flexibility could be a strong selling point.'

Speaker C: 'While it's useful, we need to balance it with feedback from users who find the numerous options overwhelming.'

Speaker A: 'True, but the majority do seem to enjoy the empowerment it provides once they get the hang of it.'

Speaker B: 'And it aligns with our vision of making a highly customizable platform. But I agree we shouldn't ignore the feedback from those who find it complicated.'

Speaker C: 'Exactly, we need to make it intuitive without sacrificing the advanced options that our power users enjoy.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. Maybe creating step-by-step guides or tutorials could help bridge that gap and address the mixed reactions.'

Speaker B: 'That's a solid idea. Enhancing usability could lead to a more positive overall experience without compromising on flexibility.'
