"Speaker A: 'I think we need to prioritize discussing the system configuration details first.'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, the configuration details are a bit overwhelming and can lead to a lot of headaches down the line.'

Speaker C: 'I get that, but if we don't tackle them early, we might run into bigger problems later.'

Speaker A: 'True, but focusing on performance enhancements could bring more value right away.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly! Improvements in performance have shown a positive impact on user satisfaction.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, with better performance, we can significantly reduce load times and enhance overall efficiency.'

Speaker A: 'And that provides a more seamless experience for our end-users.'

Speaker B: 'It’s exciting to think about how optimized performance can elevate our product and set us apart from competitors.'

Speaker C: 'While performance gains are essential, we can’t completely ignore the configuration challenges.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, but if we lead with performance, the initial positive feedback will give us momentum to tackle those issues later.'"
