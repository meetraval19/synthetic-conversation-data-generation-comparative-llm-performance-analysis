"Speaker A: 'I think adding detailed system configuration capabilities will be a game changer for our users. It could really enhance their control and customization options.'

Speaker B: 'That's a great point. Many users have asked for more personalization, so this feature would be well-received.'

Speaker C: 'While that's true, I'm concerned about our scalability. Our current infrastructure might not support the increased demand from such advanced features.'

Speaker A: 'I understand the concern, but maybe we can incorporate a phased rollout to manage the load better.'

Speaker D: 'But what about the current licensing model? Adding more detailed features could complicate access rights even further.'

Speaker B: 'The licensing issue is definitely problematic. It's already causing confusion for some customers.'

Speaker C: 'Exactly, we should avoid making it worse. Simplifying access rights could improve user satisfaction.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we could re-evaluate the licensing structure while planning the new features to ensure everything works together seamlessly.'

Speaker D: 'That sounds like a pragmatic approach. We'll need to balance user expectations with operational capabilities.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. As long as we address these concerns, the new system configuration details can be a fantastic addition.'"
