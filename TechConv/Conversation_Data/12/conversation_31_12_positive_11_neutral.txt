"Speaker A: 'I’ve been exploring the customization options in system configuration, and it's impressive how intuitive they are.' 

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, being able to tailor settings makes a big difference in user experience. It's quite a positive step forward.'

Speaker C: 'I agree, but have we considered what kind of initial guidance users might need? Configurations can be overwhelming without proper onboarding.'

Speaker A: 'That’s valid. We do have some training modules, but do you think they cover enough?'

Speaker B: 'They’re functional, but possibly not as engaging as they could be. Adding interactive elements might help.'

Speaker C: 'A neutral approach sounds sensible. Enhancing the modules without overhauling the whole system could be a balanced solution.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. We should prioritize making the configuration details accessible while also refining the training experience.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, combining an effective system setup with well-thought-out onboarding ensures users aren’t left in the dark.'

Speaker C: 'Exactly. Addressing both makes sure everyone benefits from the features we’re rolling out.'"
