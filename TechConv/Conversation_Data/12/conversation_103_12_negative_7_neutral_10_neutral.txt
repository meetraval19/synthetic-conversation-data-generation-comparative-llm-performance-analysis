Speaker B: 'I agree, but those complications always seem to manage causing more headaches each time we try simplifying.'

Speaker C: 'While that's true, we can move some focus to refining our support processes. It's crucial to ensure our clients feel heard, even if it doesn't directly change things yet.'
