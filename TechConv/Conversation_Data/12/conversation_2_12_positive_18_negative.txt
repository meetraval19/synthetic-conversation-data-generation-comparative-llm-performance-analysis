Speaker B: 'That’s great to hear! Optimizing configurations can really enhance performance metrics.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it’s also more scalable now, which opens up a lot of possibilities for future updates.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s aim for that. Maybe we can consult with legal to smooth out some of the complexities.'
