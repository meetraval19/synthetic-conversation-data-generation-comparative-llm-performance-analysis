Speaker B: 'Exactly. Right now, it's quite cumbersome, and several users have reported issues navigating it.'

Speaker C: 'True, but should we address that before finalizing our access rights structure?'

Speaker A: 'Great point. Balancing ease of access with thorough security is crucial.'

Speaker D: 'When it comes to choosing the right tool or platform for this project, how do we ensure we're making the best choice?'

Speaker B: 'It's about assessing what's most compatible with our existing infrastructure and future-proofing.'
