Speaker B: 'It's mostly straightforward, though some procedures are a bit tedious.'

Speaker A: 'I see. Well, your thoroughness in it is appreciated. Now, regarding our helpdesk operations...'

Speaker B: 'Oh, the support and escalation processes have really improved! Streamlining them has made a huge difference in response times.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. We need to collaborate on a strategic plan to enhance our scalability.'
