"Speaker A: 'I think we need to take a closer look at the system setup before we launch. It's been causing some headaches lately.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. The current setup seems unnecessarily complicated and is a constant source of issues.'

Speaker C: 'But let's not forget about our infrastructure plans. We should ensure they're scalable for future growth.'

Speaker A: 'True, focusing on that now will keep us flexible as we expand.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, but if we don't resolve the current configuration woes, it won't matter how scalable our system is. We'll be putting out fires constantly.' 

Speaker C: 'Balancing both will be key, so maybe we can address the immediate configuration challenges while keeping infrastructure improvements in sight.'"
