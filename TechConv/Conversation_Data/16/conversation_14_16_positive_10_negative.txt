Speaker B: 'Absolutely, I've noticed the same. Cross-functional meetings have become a lot more efficient as well.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, I wanted to discuss that recent feature suggestion we received. There are some concerns regarding its impact on our timeline.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We should gather more insights from our user feedback before making a decision. But in the meantime, let’s keep pushing forward with the positive momentum we’re building in collaboration.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a solid plan. It’s great that we’re maintaining such open lines of communication.'"
