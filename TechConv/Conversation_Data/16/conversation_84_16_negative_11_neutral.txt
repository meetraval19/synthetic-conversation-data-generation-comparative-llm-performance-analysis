"Speaker A: 'During the last incident, we noticed quite a few challenges in how departments communicated. It created some unnecessary delays.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The lack of clear communication channels seems to be a recurring issue. It's definitely something we need to address to prevent future problems.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. We should consider improving the way we onboard new team members too. I feel like a more structured approach could help.'

Speaker B: 'That makes sense. A well-designed training program could really set the right expectations and ensure everyone is on the same page.'

Speaker A: 'Let's prioritize these changes in our next strategy meeting to see tangible improvements.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. Addressing both aspects could really strengthen our incident response process.'"
