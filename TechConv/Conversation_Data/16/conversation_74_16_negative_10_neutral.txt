"Speaker A: 'Thank you for joining us today. How have you been finding the collaborative tools in our software?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect when it comes to communication among team members.'

Speaker A: 'I see. Could you elaborate on where the gaps are most noticeable?'

Speaker B: 'Primarily during project handovers. Important details sometimes get lost because the integration between tools isn't as seamless as expected.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds frustrating. We definitely need to address that. On another note, do you have any features you'd suggest we add?'

Speaker B: 'Perhaps a unified dashboard could help, to manage tasks and communications in one place. It's just an idea, but it might help streamline things.'

Speaker A: 'That's an interesting suggestion. We appreciate all feedback, especially when it helps improve the user experience.'

Speaker B: 'Glad to hear that. Open lines to share ideas always feel encouraging.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Weâ€™re committed to making improvements for a better workflow.'
