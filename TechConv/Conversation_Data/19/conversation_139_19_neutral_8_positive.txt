Speaker B: 'Yeah, it's always a bit tricky. They each handle scaling differently, but neither is a clear winner.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I checked them out yesterday. It’s a lifesaver, especially with the sections on best practices.'

Speaker B: 'I know! It makes implementing new features so much smoother.'"
