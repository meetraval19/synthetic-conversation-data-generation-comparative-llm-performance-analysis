Speaker B: 'I think comparing tools might help, but both have their own pros and cons.' 

Speaker A: 'Yeah, it seems neutral in terms of functionality, but we should consider scalability too.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, did you hear about the updated training modules for new engineers?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, I've seen them. They're really comprehensive and seem to speed up onboarding.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It's great to see a positive impact on productivity right from the start.'

Speaker A: 'We should incorporate some of those training resources to ensure everyone on the team benefits.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely a step in the right direction for consistent knowledge sharing.'"
