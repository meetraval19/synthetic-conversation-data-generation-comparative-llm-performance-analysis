Speaker B: 'I agree. The platform seemed to crash under pressure, which really set us back. We need something more reliable for high-demand situations.'

Speaker A: 'I’ll look into it. On a brighter note, our compliance audit went exceptionally well this time. The new protocols we implemented really paid off.'

Speaker C: 'Absolutely, maintaining compliance not only protects us but also boosts our reputation. It’s rewarding to see our hard work in action.'"
