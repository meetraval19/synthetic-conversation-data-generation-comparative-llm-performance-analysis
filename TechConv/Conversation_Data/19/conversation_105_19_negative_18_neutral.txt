"Speaker A: 'I’ve been checking the options we have for deployment tools, but none seem reliable enough for our needs.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, the current platforms are pretty disappointing. Each has its own set of issues that complicate our work.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It seems like we're just trading one problem for another. I hoped there’d be something more robust by now.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, have you looked into the latest updates on regulatory standards?'

Speaker A: 'I did. It seems like the guidelines are more of the same, not much has changed.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, although staying compliant is crucial, it feels like we're just maintaining the status quo.'

Speaker A: 'I guess we’ll have to keep an eye on both developing better tooling strategies and navigating these requirements.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, moving forward efficiently means addressing both fronts carefully.'"
