Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It seems like the materials need a revamp; they’re not very user-friendly.'

Speaker C: 'Maybe we could streamline the sessions and include more interactive elements? It might lighten the load and make it more engaging.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. We should definitely look into updating our approach to make it less daunting.'

Speaker B: 'On a more positive note, our latest security measures are proving effective. The recent privacy audits came back clean.'

Speaker A: 'Indeed, tightening up security has always been a priority for us. It’s encouraging to see the results.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Knowing our clients' data is safe boosts confidence across the board.'
