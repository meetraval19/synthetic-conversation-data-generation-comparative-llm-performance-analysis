"Speaker A: 'We've noticed some gaps in handling security incidents recently.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I think part of the issue is the current onboarding process. It's not aligning with the latest security protocols.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. New team members aren't fully prepped, which increases vulnerability risks.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps updating the training materials could help. We need a more robust and focused approach.'

Speaker B: 'I think so too. It's essential to ensure everyone knows the critical steps during an incident.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, have we reviewed our current system setup lately?'

Speaker C: 'I did check the configuration details last week. Everything seemed to be in order.'

Speaker B: 'That's reassuring. Regular reviews should help us avoid unforeseen gaps.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. A consistent approach will aid our overall readiness.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps conducting more drills could prepare the team better.'

Speaker B: 'Training improvements and regular reviews should put us on a firmer footing. Let's make it a priority.'"
