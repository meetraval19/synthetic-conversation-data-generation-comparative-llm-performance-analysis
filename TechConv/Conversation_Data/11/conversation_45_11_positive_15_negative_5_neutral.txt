"Speaker A: 'Hi there, welcome to our support line. How can I assist you today?'

Speaker B: 'Hello! I’ve just started using your software, and it’s been quite a positive experience so far. The tutorials were incredibly helpful.'

Speaker A: 'I’m glad to hear that! We put a lot of effort into ensuring our onboarding materials are top-notch to make the process smooth for everyone.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. However, I’ve been having some issues with the workflow features. I feel like they’re not as efficient as they could be.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We’ve received similar feedback. Unfortunately, optimizing those processes is challenging, and we're working hard to address those concerns.'

Speaker B: 'That’s good to know. Do you have any upcoming changes or updates planned in your roadmap that might address this?'

Speaker A: 'We have several updates lined up, though none specifically target workflow optimization just yet. Our team is evaluating various possibilities for the future.'

Speaker B: 'That’s fair. I’ll be looking forward to these updates. Hopefully, something in the future will make things more streamlined.'
