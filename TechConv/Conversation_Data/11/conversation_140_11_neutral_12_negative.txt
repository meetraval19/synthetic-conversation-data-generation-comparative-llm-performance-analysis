"Speaker A: 'During our incident response, I noticed that bringing new team members up to speed took quite some time. How do you feel about our current training procedures?'

Speaker B: 'They're fairly standard, but we could streamline to make newcomers more effective more quickly.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, having a more focused approach might help in getting everyone operational faster.'

Speaker C: 'Changing topics, I've been reviewing our system configurations, and there are several gaps that could potentially be exploited.'
