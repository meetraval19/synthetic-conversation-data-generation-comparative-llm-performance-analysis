"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing our feature priorities, and I'm concerned about the training requirements for new users. It's quite a hurdle.'

Speaker B: 'I get that, but it's also a chance to enhance our compliance features, and that's crucial for our growth. Meeting those standards is a big win.'

Speaker C: 'True, but from a design perspective, I've noticed the feedback from users doesn't strongly lean one way or another. It's neutral, but consistent.'

Speaker A: 'Consistent, yes, but we can't ignore how much of a challenge the onboarding process is. It's almost frustrating for new users.'

Speaker B: 'Conversely, every update to our compliance features strengthens our market position. We're setting a benchmark there.'

Speaker C: 'The user feedback reflects stability in our core functionalities, though. That shows we're on the right track, even if feedback is neutral.'

Speaker A: 'I'll agree about the importance of compliance features, but we have to lighten the training load.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Enhancing compliance shouldn't be at the expense of user accessibility. We can balance both.'

Speaker C: 'And maintaining that balance will likely keep user feedback steady, which might be a hidden benefit for us all.'"
