"Speaker A: 'I was reviewing the onboarding process for the new engineers, and it's looking really efficient. The training modules seem to be very comprehensive.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It’s definitely going to make the transition smoother for newcomers. However, I've been checking the recent feedback from test users…'

Speaker A: 'Ah, yes. The comments weren’t as encouraging as we hoped, right?'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Many users mentioned issues with navigating through the system. It seems there’s some confusion with the interface.'

Speaker A: 'That’s troubling. We definitely need to address those concerns swiftly. On another note, I’ve been thinking about how our system will handle growth.'

Speaker B: 'Scalability is definitely a concern. Especially with our current infrastructure, expanding too quickly might lead to performance hits.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. We need a solid plan to ensure our infrastructure can handle increased demand without any hiccups.'
