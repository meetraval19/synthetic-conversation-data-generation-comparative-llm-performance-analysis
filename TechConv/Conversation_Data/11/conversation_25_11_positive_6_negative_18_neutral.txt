Speaker A: 'Absolutely! We offer comprehensive training sessions to help new users get up to speed quickly. Our clients find them incredibly helpful.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. I've had some issues with the interface, though. It's not as intuitive as I hoped.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Weâ€™re always looking to improve, and your feedback is invaluable. Could you share specific areas where you faced difficulties?'

Speaker B: 'Sure, navigation seems a bit cumbersome, and some tasks require too many steps.'
