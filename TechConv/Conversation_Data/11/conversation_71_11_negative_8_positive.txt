"Speaker A: 'Thank you for participating in this feedback session. Can you share your experience with getting started on our platform?'

Speaker B: 'Well, to be honest, the initial setup and training were a bit overwhelming. I found it tough to understand everything without some guidance.'

Speaker A: 'I see. We’ll definitely look into making the onboarding process smoother. How did you find our technical documentation?'

Speaker B: 'Oh, the documentation is fantastic! It’s well-organized and detailed, making it easy to find the information I need.'

Speaker A: 'That’s great to hear. We aim to keep it user-friendly. Is there anything else you’d like us to improve on?'

Speaker B: 'Just the training aspect, really. If that’s sorted, I think new users would have a much better start.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, and thank you for listening.'"
