"Speaker A: 'I've been thinking about our priorities. The new user interface design is great, but we need to address the challenges with getting everyone up to speed.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. We've had some feedback that the onboarding process has been quite frustrating for new users. It's something that can affect user retention negatively.'

Speaker C: 'While that’s true, don’t forget that setting up the proper licensing and access rights is critical too. It's a bit of a balancing act to keep everything compliant.'

Speaker A: 'True, but if the initial training isn't effective, users may not even get to the point of needing access rights in the first place. We risk losing them early on.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We could consider adding more interactive tutorials or even live support sessions to enhance the training experience.'

Speaker C: 'And meanwhile, we should ensure that as the users get the hang of the system, their access setup is smooth and doesn’t hit any roadblocks. It's essential to maintain functionality, even if it’s not the most exciting focus.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, but let's prioritize improving onboarding first. Once users are confident with the basics, they'll handle licensing steps more efficiently.'

Speaker B: 'Right, as long as we refine the onboarding process, the journey should be much smoother for everyone involved.'

Speaker C: 'Sounds like a plan. Let's take these steps to ensure a cohesive experience across all aspects.'"
