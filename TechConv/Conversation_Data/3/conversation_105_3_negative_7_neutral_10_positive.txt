Speaker B: 'Yes, privacy remains a big issue. We need to address these concerns promptly to maintain trust.'

Speaker A: 'Moving on, how do we feel about the current support and escalation process? Any feedback?'

Speaker C: 'It seems to be functioning, but there might be room for making it more streamlined. It’s neither great nor bad, just in between.'
