"Speaker A: 'We need to address our security features urgently. The risks of breaches are too high right now.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Security and privacy issues are becoming critical, and users are increasingly concerned.'

Speaker C: 'I understand the urgency, but we also need to consider our onboarding process. New users find it complex.'

Speaker A: 'True, onboarding is important, but without solid security measures, we might lose trust.'

Speaker B: 'What if we balance both? Simplify onboarding while ensuring essential security protocols are in place.'

Speaker C: 'That sounds reasonable. Training teams on these aspects could also ensure we're prepared on both fronts.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, training is crucial. Proper guidance will streamline processes and reinforce our security objectives.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Letâ€™s prioritize solutions that address both our immediate and long-term concerns efficiently.'"
