Speaker B: 'It's a valid concern. Privacy issues can arise, especially with third-party integrations.'

Speaker B: 'We can implement additional encryption measures to mitigate that risk. However, there are inherent challenges with any integration.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. On a brighter note, I'm excited about the planned updates for next quarter.'

Speaker B: 'Yes! The roadmap looks promising, especially with the new features coming up.'

Speaker A: 'Integrating those features will really enhance the user experience.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. It should open up new capabilities for our platform. Looking forward to seeing it all come together!'"
