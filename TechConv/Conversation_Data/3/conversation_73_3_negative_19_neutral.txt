"Speaker A: 'Thanks for joining this interview. What are your thoughts on the security features of our platform?'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate the effort, but I noticed some issues with privacy controls.'

Speaker A: 'That's concerning. Could you share more about your experience?'

Speaker B: 'Well, while using some features, I felt my data wasn't as protected as I'd hoped.'

Speaker A: 'We’re looking into improvements. Now, how do you think our platform compares with others you've tried?'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It’s hard to overlook those concerns when comparing platforms.'

Speaker A: 'We value your feedback and will work on enhancing those aspects. Anything else you'd like to add?'
