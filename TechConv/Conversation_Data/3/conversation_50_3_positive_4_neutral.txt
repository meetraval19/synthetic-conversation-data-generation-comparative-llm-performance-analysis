"Speaker A: 'I think enhancing our app's security features should be our top priority. Users are really valuing privacy these days.'

Speaker B: 'I completely agree. Strengthening privacy measures could distinguish us in the market. It's a major selling point.'

Speaker C: 'While I see your point, we need to ensure that the new security updates are compatible with existing systems. It shouldn't hinder user experience.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely, though integrating these features with our current infrastructure might be challenging, it should be seamless for the user.'

Speaker B: 'True, but let's focus on making the app robust first. Compatibility issues can be addressed parallelly with a dedicated task force.'

Speaker C: 'That makes sense. A phased integration could allow us to adapt without disrupting current users. It keeps things smooth.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and staying flexible with our implementation should resolve most compatibility concerns, ensuring our app remains user-friendly.'"
