Speaker B: 'Hi, I'm trying to understand more about how your system handles user data and privacy.'

Speaker A: 'Sure, our system uses advanced encryption to protect data and follows all standard protocols. Your information is always secure.'

Speaker B: 'That’s reassuring to hear. Another thing—I'm having trouble accessing certain features. I think it might be a licensing issue.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. Licensing can sometimes be a bit of a hurdle. Could you share more details about what you’re experiencing?'

Speaker B: 'Whenever I try to access those features, it says my license doesn't cover them, even though I was told it would.'

Speaker A: 'I understand how frustrating that can be. Let me check your account details and see if there's something we can do to resolve this.' 

Speaker B: 'Thank you. It’s been quite inconvenient, especially when I need those features.'
