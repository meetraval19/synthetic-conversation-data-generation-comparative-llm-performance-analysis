"Speaker A: 'I went through the recent code changes, and I have some concerns about the security aspects we've implemented.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I noticed some vulnerabilities too. We might need to rethink our approach to keep data protected.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, we can’t overlook those gaps. It might lead to significant privacy issues down the line.'

Speaker B: 'Let’s prioritize fixing that. We can’t afford to compromise on security.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Now, moving on to our infrastructure scaling strategies, what are your thoughts?'

Speaker B: 'It seems solid, but I think we can further streamline the resource allocation.'

Speaker A: 'True. A bit more flexibility might help us in handling unexpected loads better.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but for now, the current setup should suffice until our next review.'

Speaker A: 'Alright, let's focus on tightening security first, then revisit scalability.'
