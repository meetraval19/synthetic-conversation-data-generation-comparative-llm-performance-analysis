"Speaker A: 'I reviewed the latest testing results, and we’re facing some major issues.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, the validation part hasn't been smooth. The error rates are still high.'

Speaker C: 'That's not good. We need to focus on why the tests are failing and address those promptly.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. While we're fixing those issues, should we discuss how our current workflows are holding up?'

Speaker B: 'Sure. I think the processes are functioning okay, but there could be room for some optimizations.'

Speaker C: 'We could streamline a few steps to improve efficiency without altering much.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s prioritize the testing fixes first, then explore workflow improvements as a secondary focus.' 

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a plan, let's tackle the testing issues head-on and monitor the results closely.'
