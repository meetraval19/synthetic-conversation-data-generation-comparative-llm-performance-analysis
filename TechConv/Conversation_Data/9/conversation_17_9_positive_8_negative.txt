"Speaker A: 'I’m pleased to report that our latest testing phase went really well. We’ve identified fewer issues than anticipated and the fixes have been smooth!'

Speaker B: 'That's fantastic news. It’s always reassuring when testing validations show such promising results.'

Speaker A: 'Good idea. In the meantime, it’s great to have positive results on the testing side to keep the momentum going.'
