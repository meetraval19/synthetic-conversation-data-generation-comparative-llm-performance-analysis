Speaker B: 'I'm quite impressed. The updates have made the system much more reliable and consistent.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. Have you considered any new changes or features that you would like us to implement?'

Speaker B: 'Well, I have some concerns. Some of the features I've hoped for seem to be taking a backseat, and it’s a bit frustrating.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. We’ll definitely look into prioritizing those. What do you think about how the system handles configuration settings?'
