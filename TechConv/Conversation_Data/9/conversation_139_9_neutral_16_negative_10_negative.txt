"Speaker A: 'We've been doing quite a bit of testing, and our validation process seems solid.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear. I just hope we can get everyone on the same page with communication.'

Speaker C: 'I agree, we've had some misunderstandings lately. It feels like we're all speaking different languages sometimes.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, that’s something we need to address. As for new features, have we reviewed the recent change requests?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but I'm concerned. Some of these suggestions seem to contradict our core objectives.'

Speaker C: 'It’s definitely a challenge. Prioritizing these changes could derail our timeline.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we should hold off on major changes until we strengthen our communication to ensure alignment.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Let’s focus on enhancing what we have before adding more complexity.'
