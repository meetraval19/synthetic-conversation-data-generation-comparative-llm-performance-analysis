Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. It seems the validation phases aren't going as smoothly as we'd hoped.'

Speaker A: 'Yeah, there are too many failed cases, which is frustrating. But on the bright side, the new bug reporting tool is incredibly efficient.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, and it’s streamlined collaboration across teams. Also, while reviewing the integration, I've found that the process for licensing access is quite straightforward now.'

Speaker B: 'That's good to hear! The simplified access rights have definitely made onboarding partners easier.'
