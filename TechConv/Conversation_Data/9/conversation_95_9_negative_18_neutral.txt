"Speaker A: 'So, we've been running into a few issues with the integration tests. The outcomes aren't looking too promising.'

Speaker B: 'That’s concerning. Have you identified where the failures are occurring?'

Speaker A: 'Mostly in the API endpoints. It's proving difficult to pinpoint exact causes, which is frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'I understand. Perhaps focusing on smaller sections might help isolate the problem areas.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. Segmenting the tests could definitely provide better insights.'

Speaker B: 'How about the regulatory side of things? Any concerns there?'

Speaker A: 'So far, we're aligning with the standard protocols, but there's always new guidelines coming out.'

Speaker B: 'Staying updated on those changes is crucial. Have you thought about automating part of that process?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, automation could streamline compliance checks. It’s something we should explore further.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Ensuring integration meets all compliance requirements from the start could save us headaches later.'"
