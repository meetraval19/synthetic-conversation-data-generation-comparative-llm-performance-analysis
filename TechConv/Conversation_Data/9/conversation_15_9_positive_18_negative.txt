Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the validation process has been smooth. It looks like the enhancements we implemented are really paying off.'

Speaker C: 'That’s great to hear. I have noticed significantly fewer issues in our reports compared to last month.'

Speaker A: 'Now, onto the compliance front. We've hit a few snags with the latest regulations. It seems like the new guidelines might require us to make some extensive adjustments.'
