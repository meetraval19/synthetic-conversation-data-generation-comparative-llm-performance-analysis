Speaker B: 'Yes, it covers all the necessary details, though it doesn't stand out in terms of innovation.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's stable, which is important, even if it isn’t the most exciting part of our roadmap.'

Speaker B: 'Now, moving on to onboarding and training, I see lots of potential for positive impact there.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely! The feedback from recent sessions has been overwhelmingly positive. People are really engaging with the new materials.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, and it’s encouraging to see how it accelerates the learning curve for new team members.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, it sets a positive foundation for their future contributions to the team.'"
