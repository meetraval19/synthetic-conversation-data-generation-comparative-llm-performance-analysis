"Speaker A: 'We've been getting a lot of feedback about how our technical documentation feels a bit lacking. It's frustrating for users trying to find specific details.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. I’ve struggled with it too. Improving it should definitely be on our radar.'

Speaker C: 'While that’s important, we also need to consider the change requests we’re receiving. Some of them could really enhance user experience, even if they aren’t urgent.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. Balance is key. But maybe we can address the documentation issues as they’re foundational.'

Speaker B: 'On another note, I've noticed questions from our clients about how our product integrates with other systems. It seems like we could focus more on compatibility aspects.'

Speaker C: 'That’s been a recurring theme. Prioritizing integration improvements would help us stay competitive.'

Speaker A: 'True, though it seems like a neutral issue for now. Could be worth exploring further once we tackle the existing documentation and change requests.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. If we organize these priorities, we can make significant progress on all fronts.'"
