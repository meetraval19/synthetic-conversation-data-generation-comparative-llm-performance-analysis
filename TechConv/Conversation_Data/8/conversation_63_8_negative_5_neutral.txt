"Speaker A: 'We really need to address issues in our technical documentation. It’s been a major pain point for both our team and users.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The lack of clarity is causing so many misunderstandings and support tickets.'

Speaker C: 'But should that take priority over the upcoming features we’ve planned? Our roadmap needs a structured approach, not constant detours.'

Speaker A: 'That’s fair. Our future plans are important, but without solid documentation, implementing those features will lead to more chaos.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and unplanned detours can compromise the quality we aim for. So, having a roadmap that considers these issues is essential.'

Speaker C: 'Yeah, our roadmap should be flexible enough to adapt, yet stable to guide our progress. Maybe we need a balanced approach.'

Speaker A: 'Improving documentation could ultimately support our roadmap by reducing backtracking and ensuring smooth implementations.'

Speaker B: 'True, addressing both in tandem might actually help us align our strategies more effectively.'
