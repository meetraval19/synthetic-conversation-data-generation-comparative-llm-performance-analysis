"Speaker A: 'Thank you for joining this feedback session. Let's start by discussing how you find our technical guides. Have they been helpful to you?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, the documentation has been a bit frustrating. It's often confusing and lacks clarity on important steps.'

Speaker A: 'I'm sorry to hear that. We want to make sure they are as clear and useful as possible. Moving on, how was your initial experience when you first started with us?'

Speaker B: 'The training sessions were actually really engaging! They made it easy for me to get up to speed quickly. I felt pretty confident after going through them.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. We're always looking to improve the onboarding process to ensure everyone feels comfortable and excited about working with us.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. The training helped a lot more than the manuals when it came to actually applying what I learned.'

Speaker A: 'Thanks for sharing. We’ll aim to bolster the guides as well, so they’re as effective as the training sessions. Your feedback is invaluable in making these improvements.'

Speaker B: 'I'm glad I could contribute. Looking forward to seeing what changes you implement!'"
