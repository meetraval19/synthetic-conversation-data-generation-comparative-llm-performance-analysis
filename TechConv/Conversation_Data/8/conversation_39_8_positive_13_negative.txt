"Speaker A: 'I appreciated how you referenced the technical documentation in your code comments. It really clarifies your approach.'  
Speaker B: 'Thanks! I believe good documentation can save a lot of time during code reviews and make future updates smoother.'  
Speaker A: 'Absolutely. Clear references make the workflow more streamlined for everyone involved.'  

Speaker B: 'However, I hit some issues with the licensing requirements for one of the libraries we considered.'  
Speaker A: 'That can be a pain. Managing licenses can sometimes slow down the integration process.'
