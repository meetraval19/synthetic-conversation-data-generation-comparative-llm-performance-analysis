Speaker B: 'I completely understand. Some sections can be pretty confusing and inconsistent.'

Speaker A: 'Right? I think some improvements could really help streamline our integration process.'

Speaker B: 'Good news is, the team’s been open to change requests. We can suggest features or corrections, and they usually respond well.'

Speaker A: 'That’s promising. I have a few ideas that could enhance usability. Maybe we can collaborate and propose these?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Let’s work on drafting a suggestion. They’ve been great with implementing feedback that enhances functionality.'"
