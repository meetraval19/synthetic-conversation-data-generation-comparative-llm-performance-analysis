"Speaker A: 'Before we dive into the incident, let's review the guidelines. The documentation is pretty thorough this time.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, having that up-to-date resource really helps keep things in order.'

Speaker A: 'True, but we've noticed some gaps with our new team members. They seem overwhelmed by the process.'

Speaker B: 'I've noticed that too. The onboarding program might need a serious overhaul before it affects our response times severely.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It feels like the training sessions aren't as comprehensive as they should be.'

Speaker B: 'We'll need to address this soon. Otherwise, it might impact our efficiency in critical situations.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed, let's prioritize this on the action list. Meanwhile, the documentation should help as an interim measure.'"
