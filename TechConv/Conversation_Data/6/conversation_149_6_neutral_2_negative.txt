"Speaker A: 'Okay, team, let's start with the recent feedback from our users.'

Speaker B: 'Right, the comments seem quite balanced this time. Some users appreciated the layout, while others found certain features less intuitive.'

Speaker C: 'I noticed a lot of neutral feedback, too. No strong opinions, just suggestions for small adjustments.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, nothing too troubling. But I'm more concerned about the performance issues.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. I've heard complaints about the app's speed and loading times. It's affecting the user experience negatively.'

Speaker C: 'It’s definitely something we need to address soon. Sluggish performance could drive users away.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We have to prioritize these performance improvements over adding new features for now.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It’s crucial to strike a balance, but performance has to be a top priority.'

Speaker C: 'Let’s gather a list of critical performance fixes and tackle those first. We can revisit the feedback on other features once this is resolved.'"
