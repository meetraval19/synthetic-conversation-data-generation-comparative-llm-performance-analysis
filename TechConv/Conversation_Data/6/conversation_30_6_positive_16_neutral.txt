Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It seems the enhancements we made are really paying off.'

Speaker A: 'Perhaps we can have a strategy session to streamline our internal communications, especially during critical moments.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed, that would likely help us respond more efficiently in the future.'"
