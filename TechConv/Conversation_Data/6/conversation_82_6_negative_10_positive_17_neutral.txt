"Speaker A: 'We've been receiving some troublesome feedback about the user experience with our current API integration.'

Speaker B: 'I’ve noticed that too. Users seem frustrated with the response time and error messages.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to look into that. On a brighter note, I’ve got some exciting ideas for new features our users have suggested.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! Adding enhancements could really boost our platform.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Now, considering scalability, how do you think our infrastructure can handle the growth?'
