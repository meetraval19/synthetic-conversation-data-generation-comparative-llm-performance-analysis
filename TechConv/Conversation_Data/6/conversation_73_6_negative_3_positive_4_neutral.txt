"Speaker A: 'We've been getting a lot of feedback from users, and it doesn't look too promising. They’re not happy with the interface.'

Speaker B: 'That's worrying. We need to address that quickly, maybe with some UX workshops or customer interviews.'

Speaker C: 'On the upside, our recent updates have significantly improved our app's security and privacy features. That's been a huge positive.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and that’s really important in today’s landscape. Users appreciate knowing their data is secure.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Now, what about our app’s compatibility with external tools? I've heard mixed responses.'

Speaker C: 'That’s more of a neutral area right now. Some integrations are smooth, others, not so much. We should probably refine that.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s focus first on user feedback and security enhancements. Integration improvements can follow once we stabilize the core functions.'"
