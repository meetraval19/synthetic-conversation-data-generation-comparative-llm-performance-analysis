"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the user feedback from our latest release, and there are quite a few concerns regarding usability.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, unfortunately, it seems like users are finding the interface a bit confusing. We need to address those issues soon.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, improving usability will be a priority moving forward. On another note, we should discuss the licensing and access rights for the new features.'
