Speaker B: 'That's great to hear! A positive user experience is definitely a strong point for our product.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. However, we've noticed some challenges when it comes to getting new users up to speed.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, the onboarding process seems to need some real attention. It’s currently a bit overwhelming for newcomers.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, we should prioritize simplifying it or enhancing the training materials to prevent discouraging new users.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. It would also help if our support resources were more user-friendly.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, I’ve heard some teams discussing the complexity around licensing rights. It doesn’t seem to cause much trouble right now, but it might need a review.'

Speaker B: 'It’s good that it’s not problematic, but you’re right, we should revisit those policies to ensure smooth access.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, maintaining clarity in access rights is crucial, even if it's currently stable.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. So, to recap, let’s keep enhancing what’s working well and tackle those onboarding issues for a more seamless transition for new users.'"
