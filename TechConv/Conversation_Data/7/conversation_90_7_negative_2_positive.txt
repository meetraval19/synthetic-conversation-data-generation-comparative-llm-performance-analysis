Speaker A: 'That's wonderful to hear! We're really focused on maintaining optimal performance. Have you encountered any areas where we could improve?'

Speaker A: 'I understand the frustration. Can you share more about what happened?'

Speaker B: 'Sure, last time I faced an issue, it seemed like my request bounced around a lot before it was addressed, which was time-consuming.'
