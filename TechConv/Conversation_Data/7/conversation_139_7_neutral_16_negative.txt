"Speaker A: 'Let's start by reviewing the support and escalation process. How’s it holding up recently?'

Speaker B: 'It's been fairly stable. The team's handling most issues effectively before they escalate.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. But I've been getting feedback about some gaps in our communication.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, I've noticed that too. There seems to be a lack of clarity between departments, especially during project handovers.'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, it has caused some delays. We need a more streamlined approach to prevent these miscommunications.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Perhaps we could introduce more regular check-ins and update meetings to keep everyone aligned.'

Speaker C: 'That’s a good start. We should also consider integrating collaborative tools to ensure transparency.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. If we tackle these gaps, we'll enhance productivity and efficiency moving forward.'"
