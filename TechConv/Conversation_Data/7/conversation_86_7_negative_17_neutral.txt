"Speaker A: 'We've been having some issues lately with the support process during API integrations. It's been quite frustrating.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, the escalation procedures have indeed been a bit slow. We're working on streamlining them to ensure quicker resolutions.'

Speaker A: 'That would be great. On another note, how should we approach planning our infrastructure for scalability with the new API?'

Speaker B: 'For scalability, we need to focus on building a flexible infrastructure. We could consider cloud solutions to easily adjust resources as needed.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds reasonable. It will allow us to handle increased traffic without significant issues.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. Proper planning can prevent potential bottlenecks, ensuring we maintain performance as demand grows.'"
