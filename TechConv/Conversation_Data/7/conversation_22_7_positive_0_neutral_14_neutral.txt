Speaker B: 'Absolutely, a robust process there could significantly decrease resolution times and improve our overall service.'

Speaker C: 'While that's true, we also need to consider clarifying some of the newer features. There have been a few queries about how they actually work.'

Speaker A: 'I see your point. Having clear documentation can definitely help users, though it seems more of an ongoing task than an immediate priority.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. However, metrics and analytics are also something we should review regularly. They give us valuable insights into where we can improve.'

Speaker C: 'That's neutral ground, indeed. Regularly checking those can guide us in fine-tuning both our features and support.'

Speaker A: 'True. It's all about balancing immediate needs with long-term goals. But, improving our support channels feels like a solid step forward right now.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, especially if we're aiming for a seamless user experience. Starting there might set a positive precedent for everything else we work on.'"
