Speaker B: 'I completely agree. The delays are causing more harm than helping, especially when issues need immediate attention.'

Speaker C: 'On a brighter note, the feedback from users has been encouraging. Many appreciate the recent updates we’ve implemented.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. Positive user experience can certainly help improve the overall perception, even during tough times.'

Speaker C: 'As of now, everything seems in the clear, but we should continue monitoring to make sure we stay compliant.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Staying proactive is key to avoiding any unforeseen compliance challenges.'
