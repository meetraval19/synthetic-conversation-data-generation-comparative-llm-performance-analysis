"Speaker A: 'I've been reviewing the API integration, and it looks like the compatibility checks are pretty straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, for most systems it's seamless. Any questions on that front?'

Speaker A: 'Not so far. I'm still exploring how it scales. Do we need any special infrastructure?'

Speaker B: 'Scalability is quite robust. As long as your setup meets the baseline requirements, you should be fine.'

Speaker A: 'Good to know. However, I’ve heard the support process can be a bit challenging. Is that true?'

Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, issues sometimes take longer to resolve than we’d like. The escalation process could definitely be improved.'

Speaker A: 'That's not ideal. Hopefully, it's something they address soon.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Meanwhile, I recommend documenting any issues meticulously to help smooth the process.'

Speaker A: 'I'll definitely do that. Thanks for the heads-up!'
