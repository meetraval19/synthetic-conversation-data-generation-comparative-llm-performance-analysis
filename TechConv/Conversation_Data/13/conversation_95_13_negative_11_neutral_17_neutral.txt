"Speaker A: 'I’m really concerned about the licensing hurdles we keep hitting. It’s becoming quite a bottleneck for our API integration.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I get that. Licensing issues can really complicate things, especially with all those restrictive access rights.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We need to ensure that our partners don’t face delays or unexpected costs.'

Speaker B: 'On a different note, how’s the onboarding process going with the newer team?'

Speaker A: 'It’s been okay so far. The training materials are helpful, but some team members feel it’s a bit general.'

Speaker B: 'That’s understandable. Tailoring it to specific use cases might make the training more effective.'

Speaker A: 'Good point. We should explore ways to make onboarding smoother for everyone involved.'

Speaker B: 'And what about scalability? Are we equipped for the potential increase in API calls after deployment?'

Speaker A: 'We’ve mapped out the infrastructure needs, so we should be able to handle an uptick in demand.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds promising, as long as our current infrastructure holds up under pressure.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. It’s something to keep an eye on as we move forward.'"
