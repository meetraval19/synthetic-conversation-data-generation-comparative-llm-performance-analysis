"Speaker A: 'In our recent meeting, the topic of licensing was brought up. I feel it's essential but not as urgent as others make it out to be.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. Licensing should be straightforward. It's important, but our current focus should lean more towards improving compatibility with new systems.'

Speaker C: 'True, but compatibility issues have been pretty challenging lately. Our product doesn't integrate smoothly with the latest operating systems.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a valid point. We’ve been receiving feedback that highlights a lot of disruptions due to these integration hitches.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We really need to address those problems. Customers are growing frustrated, leading to potential losses.'

Speaker C: 'So, are we in agreement to prioritize resolving compatibility glitches first, before diving deeper into licensing talks?'

Speaker A: 'Yes, but I still believe we should keep an eye on licensing updates too. It's something we can revisit soon.'

Speaker B: 'For now, let's focus on ensuring our system works seamlessly across platforms. That seems crucial for our users’ satisfaction.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed, focusing on smoothing out the integration is a realistic starting point for improving user experience.'"
