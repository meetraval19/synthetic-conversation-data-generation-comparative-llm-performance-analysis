Speaker B: 'Yeah, it’s pretty standard, nothing too complex there. Have you had a chance to look at the recent user feedback?'

Speaker A: 'I did, and it’s a bit concerning. Users are really struggling with the navigation on our interface.'

Speaker B: 'I know, the feedback wasn’t great. We might have to consider some redesigns to make it more intuitive.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Simplifying the layout could help reduce the confusion they're having.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Maybe we should also consider doing some user testing with actual end-users before finalizing any changes.'

Speaker A: 'That sounds like a solid plan. Should we get the team together to brainstorm some improvements?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, let’s schedule something soon. We need to turn that negative feedback around quickly.'"
