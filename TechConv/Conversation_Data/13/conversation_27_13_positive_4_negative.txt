"Speaker A: 'I'm really excited to show you our software today. One of the great things is how flexible the access rights are; you can easily scale up as your needs grow.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds promising. How does it handle compatibility with our existing systems, though? We’ve had issues before with integration.'

Speaker A: 'I understand your concern. Honestly, there have been challenges with integration depending on the legacy systems. However, we have a dedicated support team to assist with any hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'I appreciate your transparency. We just want to ensure a smooth transition. It’s crucial for our operations.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, and we’re committed to providing the necessary support to address these concerns. Plus, our flexible licensing means you can test it in smaller phases before a full rollout.'

Speaker B: 'That’s helpful. I’ll definitely discuss this further with my team. Thanks for the detailed insight.'"
