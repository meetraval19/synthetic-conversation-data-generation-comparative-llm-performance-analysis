"Speaker A: 'I'm glad we're seeing improvements in how we manage licensing and access rights. It's been a real boost to our security measures.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the streamlined process has made it much easier for us to control who gets access to what.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, the bug reporting process still feels cumbersome, don’t you think?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, it's frustrating. The delays are causing issues to pile up, and it seems like we're always behind.'

Speaker A: 'We need to address that as soon as possible. Also, I noticed that the influx of change requests lately has been overwhelming the team.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, and right now, we just don't have the bandwidth to handle so many new feature suggestions. It's adding a lot of pressure.'

Speaker A: 'Maybe it's time to prioritize and focus on what's truly essential, especially with security being our top priority.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a plan. Let’s tackle the most critical issues first and then evaluate the new requests more critically from a security standpoint.'"
