"Speaker A: 'Integrating the new API should be straightforward. The access rights are very flexible, which makes things easier for us.'

Speaker B: 'That's great to hear. Having adaptable licensing options can really simplify the process for our team.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, it allows us to focus more on the development rather than getting bogged down in permissions.'

Speaker B: 'However, I'm concerned about how the current infrastructure will handle increased demand. Scaling things up usually brings complications.'

Speaker A: 'I get that. Scaling can be tricky, especially when our resources are stretched thin. We might need a more robust plan for the infrastructure.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, if we don't address scalability properly, it could impact performance. We'll need to allocate more time and resources to this.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, it's essential to prepare for the long term. Let's ensure we have the right strategy in place to mitigate these issues.'"
