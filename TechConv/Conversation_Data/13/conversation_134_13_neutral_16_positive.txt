Speaker B: 'Yes, having clear guidelines certainly ensured no one had inappropriate access, but it didnâ€™t significantly affect our speed in resolving the issues.'

Speaker A: 'True, the guidelines were neutral in impact, but we can always refine them to maybe streamline things further.'

Speaker B: 'One thing that really stood out was how smoothly our teams communicated across departments.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, the collaboration was impressive. Everyone quickly shared information, and it really made a difference.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. We overcame those previous communication gaps effectively.'

Speaker A: 'It's great to see how positively those efforts paid off in our response this time.'
