"Speaker A: 'I just finished reviewing the code, and I noticed some issues with our licensing terms for the software libraries we're using.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, I've been concerned about that too. We need to address those access rights to avoid potential legal problems.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. It's tricky because we want to make sure everything is compliant, but it's not always straightforward.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. We might need to consult with legal for some clarity.'

Speaker A: 'On another note, have you considered what features might be part of our next phase?'

Speaker B: 'I've been thinking about it. We should probably have a brainstorming session to outline our roadmap.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds good. We should aim for a balance between innovation and maintaining what we have.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely. Setting realistic future plans will help keep us on track without overextending ourselves.'"
