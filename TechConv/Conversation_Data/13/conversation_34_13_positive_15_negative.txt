Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it's great to see that the access rights are so efficient now. It really boosts our productivity.'

Speaker A: 'I wish I could say the same about our current workflow structure. It seems like we're hitting more roadblocks than before.'

Speaker B: 'I noticed that too. Some of the processes feel a bit cumbersome, and it's definitely slowing us down.'
