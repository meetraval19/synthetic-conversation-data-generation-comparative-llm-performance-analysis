"Speaker A: 'When considering which features to prioritize, I think it's crucial we start by addressing licenses and access rights. There's a lot to discuss there.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it's a complex area, but it's fairly standardized, so we can handle it calmly.'

Speaker C: 'True, though it's critical we don't overlook it. Clarity is key for our clients and partners.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. On another note, I'm concerned about how we're currently defining the scope of some features.'

Speaker B: 'I know what you mean. It's been a bit of a headache trying to pin down exactly how everything should function.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, the misunderstandings have been frustrating. These issues need a solution before we roll them out.'

Speaker A: 'Definitely. We need to ensure everyone's on the same page, or itâ€™ll create chaos later on.'

Speaker B: 'I think a re-evaluation of the specifications with input from all teams could help. We have to be proactive about these negative impacts.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed, clear feature functionality is pivotal, otherwise we risk setting the wrong expectations.'"
