"Speaker A: 'I believe focusing on how we manage users’ access rights could set our product apart. Licensing options have become more flexible, which is a huge opportunity for us.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, customizable access levels could enhance user experience significantly. It offers more control and adaptability.'

Speaker C: 'While that’s true, we also need to consider our current system's compatibility with other platforms. It’s essential to ensure seamless integration, even if it’s not the most exciting part.'

Speaker A: 'I see your point. Ensuring that our software can easily integrate with existing systems is crucial. It might lack glamour, but it’s vital for usability.'

Speaker B: 'Both are important, but let’s not lose sight of the positive impact that improved licensing flexibility can bring, particularly in attracting more diverse users.'

Speaker C: 'Indeed, increasing our user base is important, but we should balance that with ensuring everything works smoothly for them out of the box.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Maybe we can assign teams to focus on both areas. Prioritizing these aspects could provide a comprehensive boost to our product.'

Speaker B: 'That sounds like a solid approach. By enhancing access flexibility and ensuring optimal integration, we cover our bases strategically.'

Speaker C: 'It seems like a win-win situation. We tackle the core needs while also keeping potential growth in mind. Let’s draft a plan to get started on both fronts.'"
