"Speaker A: 'I think we should prioritize enhancing our licensing model. It's really promising how new types of access rights can broaden our user base.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, making our licensing more flexible could attract more customers. Have we considered how this will impact issue reporting, though?'

Speaker C: 'That's a good point. Improving our system for bug submissions doesn't necessarily need to be top priority, but it does play a crucial role in user satisfaction.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, but if we streamline the access process, users might be happier overall, even if the reporting system stays as is for now.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed, but we also shouldnâ€™t overlook system configuration. Ensuring users have the ability to customize settings helps avoid potential problems.'

Speaker C: 'Correct, maintaining a balance in configuration options is essential, although it's not as urgent as making our access more appealing.'

Speaker A: 'So, we all agree licensing improvements should come first, but we remain mindful of our existing systems to support it, right?'

Speaker B: 'Exactly. We need to keep a neutral stance on configuration and reporting for now, while focusing on enhancing access models. That seems like the right path forward.'

Speaker C: 'Looks like we're aligned on upgrading licensing as a priority, while keeping an eye on how it interacts with our other systems. Let's proceed with that.'"
