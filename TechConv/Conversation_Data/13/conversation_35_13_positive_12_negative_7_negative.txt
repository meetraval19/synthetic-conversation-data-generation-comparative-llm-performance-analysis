"Speaker A: 'I think focusing on user access rights can really enhance our platform's flexibility.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, improving how we handle access can definitely make a positive impact. It can set us apart in the market.'

Speaker C: 'While that's true, have you considered the complexities involved in managing system configurations? We often find ourselves tangled in issues there.'

Speaker A: 'The configuration part can indeed be a headache. It usually takes up so much time and often leaves us frustrated.'

Speaker B: 'Exactly, and it's those kinds of frustrations that can delay the whole project. It's crucial we figure out a more efficient way.'

Speaker C: 'And what about our support system? The current process for handling escalations is causing a lot of dissatisfaction among customers.'

Speaker A: 'That's a valid point. The hassles with our support flow can seriously harm our reputation.'

Speaker B: 'Addressing both the configuration woes and the support pitfalls could really improve our service delivery. But should we prioritize them over licensing?'

Speaker A: 'Maybe a balanced approach is key, where we gradually improve licensing while also fine-tuning configurations and support.'

Speaker C: 'That sounds reasonable. We need to pave the way for positive user experiences without getting bogged down by system challenges.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, a thoughtful blend could be just what we need to move forward effectively.'"
