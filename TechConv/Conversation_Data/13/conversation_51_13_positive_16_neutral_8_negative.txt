Speaker B: 'That’s great! Those licenses have been a hurdle, so it's fantastic to cross that off our list.'

Speaker C: 'Speaking of the team, I've noticed some variability in how we're communicating updates. Maybe we can standardize the process a bit more?'

Speaker D: 'True, though having clarity could streamline our workflow even more.'

Speaker C: 'Yes, I spent hours trying to find relevant details last week. Updating it should be a priority.'

Speaker D: 'It’s frustrating, isn’t it? Maybe we can allocate some time soon to make necessary revisions.'"
