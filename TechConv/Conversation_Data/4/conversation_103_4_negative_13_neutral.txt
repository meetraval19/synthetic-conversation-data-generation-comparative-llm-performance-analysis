"Speaker A: 'Our team needs to decide on feature priorities for the next release. The first thing we should address is how our product integrates with existing systems.'

Speaker B: 'I agree, but the integration process is already causing issues. There are numerous compatibility problems that might delay us.'

Speaker C: 'That's definitely a concern. Should we focus more on licensing and access? It seems straightforward but still requires attention.'

Speaker A: 'Licensing is important, but we need to consider how it impacts user access as well. It's a balancing act.'

Speaker B: 'True, but integration issues might require immediate attention before they affect user experience further.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps we should dedicate resources to both. Addressing compatibility concerns and clarifying licensing terms could enhance product adoption.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, we'll need strategic planning to tackle integration challenges without neglecting licensing. A well-rounded approach is key.'"
