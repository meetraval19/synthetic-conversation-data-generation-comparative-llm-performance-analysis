"Speaker A: 'I’m really impressed with how smoothly the new module integrates with our existing tools.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the compatibility checks we implemented have really paid off.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It’s a relief to have minimal issues on that front.'

Speaker B: 'That’s a good idea. A little more guidance could certainly help newcomers understand the system better.'"
