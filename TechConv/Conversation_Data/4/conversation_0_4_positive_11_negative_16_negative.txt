"Speaker A: 'Thanks for joining us today to discuss your experience with our new tech platform. How has the integration with your existing systems been?'

Speaker B: 'Oh, it’s been great! Everything synced smoothly, and we didn’t have any major hiccups. It feels like it was designed just for us.'

Speaker A: 'That’s fantastic to hear! Now, regarding the initial setup, how would you describe the onboarding process?'
