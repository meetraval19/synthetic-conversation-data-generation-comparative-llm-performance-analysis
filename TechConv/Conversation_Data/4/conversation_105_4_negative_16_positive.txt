"Speaker A: 'I’ve been going over the integration points, and there seem to be some compatibility issues with the new module.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, I noticed that too. It’s frustrating that we didn’t catch this earlier. Maybe we should review our testing protocols to cover more scenarios.'

Speaker A: 'That’s a good idea. On another note, I’ve noticed our team has really improved communication-wise lately. The last project went smoothly because everyone was on the same page.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, the collaborative tools we implemented have made a big difference. It’s refreshing to see problems being solved so quickly with everyone pitching in.'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Hopefully, we can tackle this integration issue efficiently with the team’s support. It’s great to have such effective communication channels.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, with the way we’re working together, I’m confident we’ll sort out these challenges. It’s all about keeping that momentum going.'"
