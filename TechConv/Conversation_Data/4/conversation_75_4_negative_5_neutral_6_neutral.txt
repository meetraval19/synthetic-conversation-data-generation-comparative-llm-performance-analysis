Speaker B: 'Yes, integration challenges can cause more problems than anticipated, especially when compatibility issues arise.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. It's something we need to address head-on in our roadmap discussions.'

Speaker B: 'Speaking of the roadmap, how are we managing the plans for the upcoming releases?'

Speaker A: 'We're still mapping out future features, making sure they align with our long-term strategy without burdening our current resources.'
