"Speaker A: 'So, let's start by discussing how we should handle reporting issues in the system.'

Speaker B: 'It’s a crucial aspect. Users need an easy way to report any problems they encounter.'

Speaker C: 'Absolutely, a user-friendly reporting tool can help us gather valuable feedback. But I'm not sure it needs to be our top priority right now.'

Speaker A: 'True, it’s important but doesn’t necessarily have to be front and center. Now, about licensing or access rights...'

Speaker B: 'I’m really excited about this part. Improving access management could greatly enhance user satisfaction and security.'

Speaker C: 'Indeed, offering flexible licensing can attract more users and simplify things for them.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly, and it opens up opportunities for expanding our user base by offering different tiers.'

Speaker B: 'So, are we leaning towards prioritizing licensing improvements over the reporting tool?'

Speaker C: 'It seems like licensing could have a more significant positive impact overall, don’t you think?'

Speaker A: 'I agree. Enhancing licensing options may provide more immediate benefits while we still keep an eye on improving the reporting tool.'"
