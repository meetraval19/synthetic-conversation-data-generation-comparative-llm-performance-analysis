"Speaker A: 'Morning, everyone. Let's dive into the issues from yesterday. There was a new request for an additional feature from the client. Any thoughts on that?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I’m concerned. Adding features at this stage could disrupt our timeline.'

Speaker C: 'I agree. It might delay other critical tasks if we don't manage it carefully.'

Speaker A: 'Good points. Let's keep an eye on it and see if we can negotiate the scope.'

Speaker D: 'On a different note, has anyone checked the recent updates on the API? How's the integration going?'

Speaker B: 'It's stable so far. No major issues, just a few adjustments here and there.'

Speaker C: 'Yeah, nothing that stands out as problematic. We should be fine with the current setup.'

Speaker A: 'Great, let's keep it that way. Now, about the compliance checks, any updates?'

Speaker D: 'Yes, the latest round was successful. We're finally aligned with the new regulations.'

Speaker B: 'That’s excellent news! Ensuring compliance is crucial for our reputation.'

Speaker C: 'Absolutely, this will surely boost client confidence in our project.'
