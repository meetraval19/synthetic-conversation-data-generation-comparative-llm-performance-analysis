"Speaker A: 'Let's review your performance this quarter. I noticed you're handling change requests quite often. How do you find them?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, it's been challenging. Some of the suggestions seem unnecessary and time-consuming, without adding much value to the product right now.'

Speaker A: 'I understand. It's important to balance what's feasible with the benefit. How about the team's communication? Any improvements there?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! Our team meetings have become much more efficient. The open discussions have really boosted our project outcomes.'

Speaker A: 'That's great to hear. Good collaboration is key. What about the support and escalation process?'

Speaker B: 'It's working well. The new system ensures issues are escalated promptly, and we're resolving them faster.' 

Speaker A: 'Fantastic. It's essential to maintain that positivity across the team. Let's focus on refining those change requests next.' 

Speaker B: 'Agreed. Thanks for the feedback!'"
