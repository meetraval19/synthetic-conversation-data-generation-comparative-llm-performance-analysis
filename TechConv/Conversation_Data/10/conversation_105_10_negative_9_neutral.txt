"Speaker A: 'In our recent security audit, we received a change request for a new feature. What are your thoughts on that?'

Speaker B: 'Honestly, I'm not thrilled about it. Introducing changes now could disrupt our current security protocols.'

Speaker A: 'I agree, especially because we're still in the midst of addressing the existing vulnerabilities.'

Speaker C: 'On a related note, how are we doing with our testing and validation phases?'

Speaker A: 'The tests have been mostly routine so far, neither good nor bad, just the usual.'

Speaker B: 'It's important to keep a steady pace with testing to ensure no stone is left unturned.'

Speaker C: 'Absolutely, consistency is key to maintaining system integrity.'

Speaker A: 'I'll compile our observations and share them in our next meeting to evaluate where we stand.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds good. Let's keep the change requests at bay until we're fully confident in our current security posture.'"
