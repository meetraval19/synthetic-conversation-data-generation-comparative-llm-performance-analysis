"Speaker A: 'We've had a recent issue with our infrastructure, and there are concerns about implementing new requests too quickly.'

Speaker B: 'I understand, rushing to add new features can lead to vulnerabilities.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. Itâ€™s not the right time to entertain new suggestions when we're still addressing existing problems.'

Speaker C: 'Agreed. But let's focus on our support and escalation processes. They've been quite effective, ensuring swift responses to incidents.'

Speaker B: 'Yes, our response time has improved significantly. The team has been proactive in tackling issues as they arise.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely, the support system is crucial. However, we must also consider the impact on scalability and infrastructure.'

Speaker C: 'Scalability does remain a challenge, but it's something we need to plan methodically.'

Speaker B: 'Indeed. A structured approach to infrastructure planning will help us remain flexible as our needs grow.'

Speaker A: 'Right, and alongside this planning, we should maintain our current robust support systems.'
