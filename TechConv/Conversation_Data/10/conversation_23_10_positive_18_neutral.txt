Speaker A: 'With the positive impact this feature could bring, I think it’s worth the effort to address any compliance aspects upfront.'

Speaker B: 'Definitely, and integrating early compliance assessments in the process should safeguard against future setbacks.'

Speaker C: 'All right, let’s prioritize this carefully and ensure all bases are covered. It could really be a game-changer if done right.'"
