"Speaker A: 'Our compliance updates are on track, and it feels great to be ahead of regulatory demands this quarter.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, it’s reassuring to know we’re aligned with all the regulations.'

Speaker C: 'I agree, but we need to dive into the onboarding process improvement. The feedback suggests it's overwhelming for new users.'
