"Speaker A: 'I've been really impressed with how we've managed to meet the compliance standards this quarter. It’s been a big win for us!'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely, staying ahead of regulations not only keeps us in the clear but strengthens trust with our clients.'

Speaker C: 'Trust is critical, but I’m curious how that fits into our long-term plans. What's next on our roadmap?'

Speaker A: 'Good question. Our roadmap has a few potential paths, but I'm keen to hear thoughts on the most practical way forward.'

Speaker B: 'Well, there's been some debate about which features should take precedence. The roadmap feels a bit ambiguous at the moment.'
