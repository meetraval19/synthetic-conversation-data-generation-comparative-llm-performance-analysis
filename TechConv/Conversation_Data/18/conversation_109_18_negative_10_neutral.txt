"Speaker A: 'We've got a new feature suggestion that seems promising for our app.'  

Speaker B: 'It sounds interesting, but we need to consider the compliance aspects. Regulatory hurdles can be tricky.'  

Speaker C: 'I understand the concerns, but focusing too much on regulations might slow us down.'  

Speaker A: 'True, but we should balance innovation with compliance. Perhaps we can consult legal early in the process.'  

Speaker B: 'Good idea. We can flag potential issues before they become a problem.'  

Speaker C: 'For the feature suggestion, maybe we can start with a pilot. Itâ€™ll give us time to ensure all compliance checks are in place.'  

Speaker A: 'That seems like a reasonable middle ground. We stay agile yet compliant.'  

Speaker B: 'Agreed. The key is to avoid being caught off-guard by regulatory changes later on.'  

Speaker C: 'So, we're all set to proceed cautiously and creatively? Sounds like a plan.'"
