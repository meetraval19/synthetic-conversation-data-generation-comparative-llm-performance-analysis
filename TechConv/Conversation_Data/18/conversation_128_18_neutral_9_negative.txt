Speaker B: 'So far, we seem to be aligned with the necessary guidelines. Not much to change there.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. It's good to see that we’re on track with that.'

Speaker B: 'Now, about the testing phase, I'm concerned. Have you seen the recent validation results?'

Speaker A: 'Yeah, they’re not as promising as we hoped. There are quite a few issues that need to be addressed.'

Speaker A: 'I think we need to dedicate more resources to tackling these issues in our next sprint.'
