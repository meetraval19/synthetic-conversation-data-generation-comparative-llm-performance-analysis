"Speaker A: 'Good morning, everyone. Let's start with any updates on our compliance checks.'

Speaker B: 'We've reviewed all the necessary protocols and everything seems to be in order. No major concerns for now.'

Speaker C: 'That's good to hear. Moving on, I've noticed some issues with the current application speed that's affecting user experience.'

Speaker D: 'Right, the performance is definitely below our expectations. We need to address those latency issues.'

Speaker A: 'Agreed. Let's allocate some time this week to dig into the code and improve the response time.'

Speaker C: 'What about our goals for the next quarter? Are we adjusting our roadmap based on these issues?'

Speaker B: 'It might be necessary. Given the current hurdles, we should reassess our future plans and perhaps delay some of the upcoming features.'

Speaker D: 'I think focusing on fixing these performance problems should take priority over new developments at this stage.'

Speaker A: 'Let's make it a point to discuss the roadmap in detail during our next meeting and re-prioritize our tasks if needed.'"
