Speaker B: 'I agree. The non-compliance with new regulations could be problematic for us.'

Speaker A: 'We must prioritize mitigating these gaps to avoid potential penalties.'

Speaker C: 'While we're on that, have you looked into different monitoring tools? Comparing their features might help us stay ahead.'

Speaker B: 'Yeah, it’s essential to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.'

Speaker C: 'Perhaps a trial period for a couple of options might give us better insights.'

Speaker A: 'Let’s set that up then. Meanwhile, I'll draft a plan to tackle the compliance issues.'

Speaker B: 'Sounds like a solid approach. We need to ensure we're prepared for the next review.'"
