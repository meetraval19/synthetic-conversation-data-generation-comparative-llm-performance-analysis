Speaker B: 'The system configuration is pretty straightforward. We're aligning it with our existing infrastructure.'

Speaker A: 'That's good to hear. Have you placed any focus on ensuring compatibility with compliance standards?'

Speaker B: 'Yes, but there are a few troubling areas. The regulatory requirements are quite stringent this year.'

Speaker A: 'That does sound challenging. Let me know if you need help navigating those compliance hurdles.'

Speaker B: 'Will do. On a brighter note, our testing phase went really well. The validation results were quite promising.'

Speaker A: 'That's fantastic! A successful test phase is always encouraging. It should help us move forward with confidence.'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely. Even with the compliance issues, seeing a positive outcome from testing keeps the team motivated.' 

Speaker A: 'It sounds like we're on the right track. Just keep pushing through those regulatory obstacles, and weâ€™ll have a successful integration.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. With the configurations set and testing showing positive signs, we just need to iron out those compliance details.'"
