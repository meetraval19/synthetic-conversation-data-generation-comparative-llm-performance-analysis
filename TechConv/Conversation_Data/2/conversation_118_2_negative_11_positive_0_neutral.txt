"Speaker A: 'So, should we focus on boosting the speed of our platform first?'

Speaker B: 'I get the concern, but performance optimization seems like a challenging task that might delay our release.'

Speaker C: 'Improving speed is crucial, but I'm more inclined towards enhancing user experience through easier onboarding.'

Speaker A: 'That's a great point. A seamless introduction for new users could really improve adoption rates.'

Speaker B: 'True, but we should be clear about what functionalities we prioritize. We need clarity on which features align best with our customer needs.'

Speaker A: 'So, would it be wise to allocate some resources to performance while also prioritizing onboarding improvements?'

Speaker B: 'Balancing both could be tricky, especially if the performance issues are complex.'

Speaker C: 'Letâ€™s also make sure we have detailed documentation and training sessions ready. Effective training can alleviate a lot of concerns.'

Speaker A: 'Absolutely. If we focus on clear documentation and a structured training program, this can be a win-win.'
