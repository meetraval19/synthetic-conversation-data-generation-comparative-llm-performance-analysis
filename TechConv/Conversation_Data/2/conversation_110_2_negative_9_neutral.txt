"Speaker A: 'Let's dive into the code review. I'm worried about how this module might handle heavy loads.'

Speaker B: 'You're right. We've noticed the current implementation struggles with performance under stress testing.'

Speaker A: 'Exactly. We'll need to optimize those functions to avoid bottlenecks.'

Speaker B: 'On the testing front, though, we've got decent coverage. Most tests are passing, but a few edge cases still need validation.'

Speaker A: 'Good to hear. We'll make sure to address those last few cases to ensure stability.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed, once performance issues are ironed out, and testing is complete, we should be in better shape.'

Speaker A: 'Sounds like a plan. Let's focus on optimization and finalize the remaining tests.'"
