Speaker B: 'Unfortunately, we've seen some dips in speed during peak hours. It's something we need to address soon.'

Speaker C: 'Yeah, it seems our system struggles under high traffic, which is impacting user experience.'

Speaker A: 'That's definitely a concern. Let’s prioritize it for the next sprint.'

Speaker B: 'Agreed. On another note, I wanted to discuss our support and escalation process.'

Speaker A: 'Let's look into optimizing it without major changes for now.'

Speaker C: 'Sounds good. How about the new app integration? It’s been going pretty well, hasn't it?'

Speaker B: 'Absolutely! I’ve noticed the modules are syncing perfectly with our existing system.'

Speaker A: 'Excellent! The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It’s great to see compatibility improving our workflow.'
