"Speaker A: 'Our current system's performance during the incident was less than ideal. We need to address these concerns seriously.'

Speaker B: 'I agree. The slow response times were problematic. It affected our ability to manage the situation efficiently.'

Speaker A: 'Yes, it's clear that performance optimization has to be a priority to prevent future issues.'

Speaker C: 'On the topic of improving our processes, do you think refining our workflow could help mitigate such risks?'

Speaker B: 'Optimizing our workflow seems like a neutral approach that could certainly streamline response efforts without overhauling everything.'
