Based on the provided conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Licensing or Access Rights",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers express clear concerns about their infrastructure's ability to scale, discussing potential bottlenecks and performance risks, which indicates a negative sentiment toward this topic. Conversely, they share enthusiastic feedback about their new flexible licensing model, highlighting positive user reception and its alignment with broader market goals, demonstrating a positive sentiment.
