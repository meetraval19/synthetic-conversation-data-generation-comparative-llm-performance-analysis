I'll analyze the conversation to identify topics from the provided list and determine sentiment toward each.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Metrics or Analytics Review",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Workflow or Process Optimization",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
