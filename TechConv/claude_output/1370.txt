Based on the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and their corresponding sentiment:

```json

      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Onboarding or Training Needs",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {

  ]
}
