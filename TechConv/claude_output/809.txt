Based on the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Technical Documentation Reference",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "System Configuration Details",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
