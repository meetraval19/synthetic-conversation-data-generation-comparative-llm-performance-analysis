Based on the provided conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment towards each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support and Escalation Process",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this conversation, Speaker A discusses upcoming features and enhancements planned for the software (Roadmap or Future Plans), which Speaker B responds to positively with "It sounds like a solid plan." 

The Support and Escalation Process is initially brought up as a concern by Speaker B, but after Speaker A provides details about their support team and processes, Speaker B expresses clear positive sentiment with phrases like "That's reassuring to hear" and "That definitely adds peace of mind."

Both topics receive positive responses from the speakers, indicating satisfaction with both the future direction of the software and the support mechanisms in place.
