After analyzing the conversation, I can identify the following topics and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Licensing or Access Rights",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "User Experience Feedback",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Change Request or Feature Suggestion",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Collaboration or Communication Gaps",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
