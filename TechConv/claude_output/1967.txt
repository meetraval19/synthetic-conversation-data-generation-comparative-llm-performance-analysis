Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the underlying topics and analyzed the sentiment toward each:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Tool or Platform Comparison",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
