Based on the conversation, I've identified the underlying topics discussed and analyzed the sentiment for each:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "User Experience Feedback",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Bug or Issue Reporting",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Change Request or Feature Suggestion",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
