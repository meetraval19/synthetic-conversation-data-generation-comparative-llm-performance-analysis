Looking at the provided conversation, I'll identify the underlying themes and perform sentiment analysis.

After analyzing the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B during the software demo, I can identify several inferred topics from the reference list that aren't explicitly named but are clearly discussed:

1. Support and Escalation Process: This is inferred from Speaker B's concern about the slow implementation time for feature change requests and Speaker A's acknowledgment of this issue. The sentiment is negative as both parties recognize this as a problem area.

2. Workflow or Process Optimization: This is inferred from the discussion about how the software can enhance team efficiency and integrate with existing processes. Speaker A presents this positively, highlighting how the tracking feature offers comprehensive insights and integrates with existing workflows.
