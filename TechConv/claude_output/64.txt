Based on the conversation between the app company representative and the user providing feedback, I've identified these underlying topics and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Feature Functionality Clarification",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "User Experience Feedback",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Integration or Compatibility Inquiry",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
