Based on the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed their sentiment:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Compliance or Regulatory Concerns",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Support and Escalation Process",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
