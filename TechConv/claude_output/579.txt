Looking at this conversation, I need to identify the underlying themes and analyze the sentiment for each one based on the provided topic list.

{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Integration or Compatibility Inquiry",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Workflow or Process Optimization",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
