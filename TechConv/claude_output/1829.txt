Based on the conversation, I've identified the main topics being discussed and analyzed the sentiment towards each:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Metrics or Analytics Review",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
