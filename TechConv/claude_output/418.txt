Analyzing the conversation, I can identify the underlying themes discussed and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Security and Privacy Discussion",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "User Experience Feedback",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```
