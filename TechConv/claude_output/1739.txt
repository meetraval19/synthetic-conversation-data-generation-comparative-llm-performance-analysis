Based on the conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment for each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Collaboration or Communication Gaps",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Licensing or Access Rights",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```
