Based on the provided conversation, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment towards each topic.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Change Request or Feature Suggestion",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Performance Concerns",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The first topic is evident when Speaker B tries to request an adjustment to the app to fit their workflow, and Speaker A responds that it might not be feasible due to the system's framework. Speaker B explicitly mentions feeling "disappointed" about this limitation.

The second topic emerges when Speaker B reports that the app slows down during peak hours (midday). While Speaker A offers to look into optimizing server loads, the sentiment from Speaker B is negative as they're reporting an issue that impacts their team's productivity during their heaviest workload.
