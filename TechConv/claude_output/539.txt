Based on the conversation, I've analyzed the underlying topics and their sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Licensing or Access Rights",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Workflow or Process Optimization",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
