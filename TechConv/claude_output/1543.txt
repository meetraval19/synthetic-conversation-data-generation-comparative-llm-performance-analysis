Based on my analysis of the conversation, I've identified the main topics being discussed and their associated sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Metrics or Analytics Review",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The speakers show a positive attitude toward using metrics and data to guide their decisions, with Speaker A emphasizing their importance for an unbiased approach and Speaker B agreeing it's a good starting point.

However, they express concern about infrastructure scaling, with Speaker C directly stating worry about the current setup's ability to handle growth, Speaker A highlighting the costs and complexity involved, and Speaker B warning about potential setbacks without proper planning - all indicating a negative sentiment toward this topic.
