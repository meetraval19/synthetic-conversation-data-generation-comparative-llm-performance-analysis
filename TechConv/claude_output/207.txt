After analyzing the conversation, I can identify these underlying themes from the provided topic list:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Performance Concerns",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Feature Functionality Clarification",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation shows that Speaker B has a positive sentiment toward system performance, noting "significant improvement" and that it feels "much faster and more responsive compared to before."

However, when discussing feature functionality, Speaker B expresses a negative sentiment, stating they're "a bit unsure about their functions" and finding it "a bit confusing without detailed guidance" - indicating dissatisfaction with the clarity of features despite the qualifying statement that "it's not bad."
