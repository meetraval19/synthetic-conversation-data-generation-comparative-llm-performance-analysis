Based on the provided conversation, I've analyzed the underlying themes and sentiments:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Performance Concerns",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Bug or Issue Reporting",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation primarily revolves around system performance enhancement, which all speakers view positively, expressing excitement about potential improvements in speed, efficiency, and user experience. 

The second major theme is bug tracking and issue reporting, which carries a negative sentiment as Speaker C expresses frustration about glitches not being promptly addressed and concerns about the current infrastructure for reporting issues.
