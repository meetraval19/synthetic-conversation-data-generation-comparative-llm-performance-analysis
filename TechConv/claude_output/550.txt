After analyzing the conversation, I've identified several underlying themes from the provided topic list and assessed the sentiment towards each:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Licensing or Access Rights",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Performance Concerns",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation touched on product roadmap concerns, with Speaker B initially worried but somewhat reassured, resulting in a neutral sentiment. The discussion about licensing flexibility was clearly positive, with Speaker B responding "Fantastic, that's exactly what we're looking for." Similarly, when discussing software performance under heavy workloads, Speaker B explicitly stated "That's reassuring," indicating a positive sentiment toward the performance capabilities described.
