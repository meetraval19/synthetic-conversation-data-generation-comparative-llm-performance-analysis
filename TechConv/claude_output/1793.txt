Based on the conversation, I've identified several underlying themes from the provided topic list and analyzed the sentiment toward each:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Scalability and Infrastructure Planning",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Performance Concerns",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Workflow or Process Optimization",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    }
  ]
}
```
