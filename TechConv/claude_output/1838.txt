Based on the provided conversation, I'll identify the underlying themes and analyze the sentiment for each topic:

```json

      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Compliance or Regulatory Concerns",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
