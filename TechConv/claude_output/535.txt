Looking at the conversation, I can identify several underlying topics from the provided list. I'll infer these topics and analyze the sentiment based on the speakers' attitudes:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Roadmap or Future Plans",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "User Experience Feedback",
      "sentiment": "neutral"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Integration or Compatibility Inquiry",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    }
  ]
}
```
