Based on the conversation provided, I've identified the underlying themes and analyzed the sentiment for each topic:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Onboarding or Training Needs",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "System Configuration Details",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Security and Privacy Discussion",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
