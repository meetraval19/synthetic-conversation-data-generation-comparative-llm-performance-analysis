Based on the provided conversation, I'll identify the underlying themes and analyze the sentiment for each.

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic": "Compliance or Regulatory Concerns",
      "sentiment": "positive"
    },
    {
      "topic": "System Configuration Details",
      "sentiment": "negative"
    }
  ]
}
```

The conversation clearly shows a positive sentiment toward compliance and regulatory concerns, with speakers noting that integration of latest standards "looks great" and "builds trust with clients," while expressing a negative sentiment toward system configuration details, describing them as "convoluted" with "complexities that might lead to operational hiccups."
